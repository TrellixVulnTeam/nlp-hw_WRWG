new questions about attacking iraq ; is torturing terrorists necessary ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala well , we 'll debate that later on in the show . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll have a couple of experts come out , so i 'll withhold my comments until then . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even as the secretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert last month , a 30 - foot cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men landed on american shores , utterly undetected by the coast guard secretary ridge now leads . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of republican political hacks instead of professionals , by the way ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
attorney general john ashcroft , for example , is a career politician . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he lost an election to a dead man . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
tom ridge is another career politician who was passed over by mr. bush for the vice presidency . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and deputy secretary of homeland security asa hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful bob jones university . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
apparently , mr. bush only turns to professionals when it 's really important , like political consulting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
novak paul , as i understand your definition of a political -- of a professional politician based on that is somebody who is elected to public office . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
now in your administration , the clinton administration , there were these members of the cabinet who by your definition were professional politicians -- lloyd bentsen , les aspin , william s. cohen , janet reno , bruce babbitt , mike espy , dan glickman , norman mineta , henry cisneros , federico pena , bill richardson , richard riley , 12 of them , not to mention former democratic national chairman ron brown , and one of the great professional politicians of all time , bill daly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and you know what , they did a hell of a job for our country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and these bozos let four armed cubans land on our shores when they 're trying to make a high terrorist alert . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our president has put homeland security in the hands of failed republican hacks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it 's ok -- it 's ok to have professional politicians at the justice department and the pentagon ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala janet reno was a career prosecutor . |||O O O O O O O O 
just a minute , let me finish my sentence , please . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's ok to put democratic career politicians at the pentagon and the justice department if they 're democrats but not if they 're republicans , is that right ? |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , the difference is janet reno was a career prosecutor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala john ashcroft was n't half the woman that janet reno was . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
another potential democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to run , and he made his announcement , and surprise , surprise , the answer was no . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
senator christopher dodd of connecticut made the announcement today that he would not be the 10th candidate for the nomination . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
dodd is at least more credible than carol moseley - braun or dennis kucinich . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he explained he could better spend the next two years on homeland security , the economy and judicial nominations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
i guess that means harassing tom ridge , fighting tax cuts and obstructing president bush 's plans to reform judiciary . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's all i can say . |||O O O O O O O 
he would have brought a lot to the race . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
he brings a lot to the senate and to the debate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i 'm glad that he 's going to be fighting those fights . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , the commerce department reports today that consumer spending declined in january and that the manufacturing sector slowed in february . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in all , two million americans have lost their jobs under president bush so far , not to mention three of them being the top three leaders of his economic team . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
meanwhile , the deficit now at $ 300 billion . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it could swell to as much as $ 500 billion if we go to war in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
mr. bush apparently is untroubled by this fiscal collapse . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
one of his aides tells the current issue of " time , " magazine , quote , " even if it 's $ 500 billion , so what ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course , even a $ 500 billion deficit number does n't count the $ 3 trillion mr. bush is robbing from the social security trust fund . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , we should have known , every time george w. bush gets in trouble , he borrows from a trust fund . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's been his whole life , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
let me give you two economic facts of like , which you should know , even if you wo n't recognize them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
number one , there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and number two , there is no social security fund , virginia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala because bush squandered it on his tax cuts . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
there never has been one . |||O O O O O O 
there has been one for 60 years . |||O O O O O O O O 
new questions about attacking iraq ; is torturing terrorists necessary ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
novak former arkansas governor and u.s. senator dale bumpers has just published a memoir called " the best lawyer in a one - lawyer town . " |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and it spans his life from the depression era to the clinton era . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let 's ask him which was more depressing . |||O O O O O O O O O 
begala first , thank you for writing this book . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and then we read you one passage . |||O O O O O O O O 
you cite a session you had with president lyndon johnson in austin , i guess , at his ranch , right ? |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here is what you quote our president johnson to you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
" when i was majority leader , and later president , i spent all my time pulling every power string i could find to pull , trying to pass bills that helped people . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that made their lives better and the country stronger . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's what the democrats stand for . " |||O O O O O O O O O 
republicans just stand for two things : protecting the rich and investigation democrats . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's true , though , is n't it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
johnson was right , was n't he ? |||O O O O O O O O 
i thought that was one of the most prescient things i ever heard , and that was long before white water . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he never heard of ken starr , but he anticipated it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
novak can i interrupt this democratic picnic for just a minute ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , senator , inadvertently , you gave support in this book to one of my pet political themes , which you probably do n't agree with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on page 256 you say , " as the years went by " -- this is when you were in the senate -- " less and less information was new , fewer and fewer arguments were fresh , and the repetitiveness of the old arguments became tiresome . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" i was becoming almost as cynical as my constituents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i knew it was time to leave . " |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O 
is n't that a great argument for term limits ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i know very few senators or any who are as good in their third term as they are in their first term . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
should n't we limit them to two terms ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
first of all , that statement is not designed to cover everybody in the united states senate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i must say , that 's a pretty accurate statement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but it has nothing do with term limits , in my opinion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think term limits is the worst idea i ever heard of . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let me turn one more page , to page 257 , actually , right next door to where bob was reading . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this struck me because you 've got the courage to say something that is heretical today and it 's music to my ears . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you say , " partisanship has taken on an odious connotation , and it may indeed be shriller now than ever . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but we should n't lose sight of the fact that we have two political parties so people will have choices . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if everybody agreed on everything , it might be a tranquil society , but it surely would be a dole one , and certainly not certainly a good one . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , paul , that 's the reason we have two parties , so people have a choice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i 've said many times , if we all agreed on everything , everybody would want to marry betty and we would really be in a mess , would n't we , bob ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
novak senator bumpers , of the 22 senators of the old confederacy , when i got to washington with the associated press , 45 years ago , 22 of them were democrats , nine were republicans . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now 13 are republicans and nine are democrats . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and of the democrats , i do n't think there is a real liberal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
your last year in the senate i had an interview with you and i wrote a column called " the last southern liberal . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a very flattering article , bob . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and you said , i 'll quote it , you said , today 's southern voters are " children of democrats who are not swayed by the same things their mothers and fathers were . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they certainly are susceptible to the republican message . " |||O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's a good future for the democratic party in the south . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bob , i think that the reason everybody in the south -- you know , first of all , we were -- when franklin roosevelt was elected president , we had been living what we thought was still a conquered nation after the civil war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI 
and we felt that franklin roosevelt was the first person who ever really acknowledged that the south had peculiar problems . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and from that time on , that 's the reason we had 22 democratic senators from 11 confederate states , is because of the civil war and because of what we thought was a heavy hand of the federal government all the time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course there was always that old story about the yankees , and yankees were synonymous with republicans . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but that 's all changed and memories have dimmed . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and people , you know , they do n't remember that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and so the message , the republicans have actually had a golden opportunity to make their case and they 've done it successfully . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and the democrats need desperately to get a message to counter that , and they need to get a message and stay on it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean we can not be all over the lot. |||O O O O O O O O O O 
novak ( unintelligible ) they 're just not buying the new deal anymore in the south . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're not buying a new deal . |||O O O O O O O O 
but i 'll tell you the message the democrats ought to be -- that every time we get sort of within the grasp of the golden age , i mean within reach of the golden age , where everybody has health care , where everybody get s a good education -- you know i 'm one of the million and a half people -- my brother went to harvard , i went to northwestern university . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
two schools my father could n't have even thought about affording . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a million and a half veterans came out of war world ii on the gi bill and got that kind of an education . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if that makes me a liberal , because i believe the government has a role to play in that , then i am a certified liberal , because i think that made the country stronger . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think certainly it made every one of those people stronger , and i think we ought to be doing it right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no child in this country ought to be deprived of an education for lack of money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no elderly person ought to have to make a choice between food and medicine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they do it by the millions every day . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
will you run for president ? |||O O O O O O

case in point , khalid shaikh mohammed . |||O O O O O O O O 
it 's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm chewing gum and talking on the phone while writing this note . " |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
joshua , you could n't have said anything better . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
in fact , i 've already said it . |||O O O O O O O O O 
begala well , in fact , our allies got mr. mohammed along with us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and bush is so far angered every ally we have . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
dan snyder of baden , pennsylvania writes , " bush should torture the al qaeda chief operations officer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O

why should this guy get preferential treatment ? " |||O O O O O O O O O 
novak and i thought he was -- i thought he was busy running the redskins . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the next comment is from frank mastro of new york city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" mr. novak , i do n't understand the problem . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the budget goes through as is , why do n't mr. begala and mr. carville just donate the extra tax money they do n't want ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
i say that to all the rich millionaire democrats , like carville and begala , who do n't want tax cuts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'll donate to the democrats . |||O O B-TRI O O O O 
they 'll defeat bush and everybody will get rich . |||O O O O O O O O O O

he has n't been able to answer it . |||O O O O O O O O O

begala look , we need allies to catch these guys . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we got him because the pakistanis got him . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we go to war in iraq , 200,000 people start protesting in pakistan , they put too much pressure on the government . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with us like they 're cooperating now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we go to war in iraq , it would be the worst thing we can do ... |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know the one thing the democrats ca n't stand is good news . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is just something you can not handle . |||O O O O O O O O O 
what i ca n't stand is a president who is going to screw up our war against terrorism when i thought that was his job . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O

both the ama and the bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
president bush points this way today , even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money , premiums go up and either way , the patient pays . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else 's lawsuits , but instead focus on his own experience . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O 
he was the governor of my state of texas , where there are a whole lot of doctors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it turns out that he did n't do any kind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of texas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here 's what the " dallas morning news " reported recently : " the texas state board of medical examiners , the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
it has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors , who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is the bush record in policing surgeons , why should we trust him now ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala physicians generally , not just surgeons , forgive me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
what we need to do is to make sure that state boards , number one , have adequate funding . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
well , it 's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because someone pays money in a case , the insurance company may pay money because they 're afraid there 's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
troy brennan ( ph ) of harvard said there 's no correlation with negligence , only with disability . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so let 's look at all of the facts , but give everybody due process here in america before we criticize . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nader actually , troy brennan , the same doctor at harvard public school of health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits , it 's too many . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O 
less than 10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice , and we 're talking about horrific injuries here , even file a claim . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
and the entire pay - out to all of the victims that get a little money , not the 90 percent who never file a claim , amounts to less than what we spend on dog food . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's about $ 5.4 billion is the pay -out . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI 
that 's a fraction of physician income . |||O O O O O O O O 
it 's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's what the people in congress have to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but let me - but let me - wait ... |||O O O O O O O O O O 
nader doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium , right ? |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
they do n't abandon their patients , except for the high premiums of a few specialties ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but first of all let me ... |||O O O O O O O 
why do n't you crack down on the insurance companies ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
let 's talk about the facts . |||O O O O O O O 
let 's talk about the facts . |||O O O O O O O 
palmisano ( unintelligible ) percent of the doctors are insured by physician - owned insurance companies , the medical side . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was just in oklahoma , they own this insurance company . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are trying to do their very best . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a company not for profit . |||O O O O O O O O 
what happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and as far as the investment income , a.m. bests ( ph ) show that in the past five years , the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
brown brothers harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nader ... payoffs have been stable , adjusted for inflation , national practitioners databank ( ph ) . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
why do you want that to be secret ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
all of the information about bad doctors in the national practitioner bank , you , the ama wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , let 's look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
let 's listen to what he said to the ama today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if harmed by a doc , they ought to be able to recover their economic costs , economic losses . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
they should be able to recover non - economic damages as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but for the sake of the system , non - economic damages should be capped at $ 250,000 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what in the world is wrong with that ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
tell me what 's wrong with that ? |||O O O O O O O O 
tell someone who had a double mastectomy , tell an infant who 's brain - damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they 're going to get dribbled out $ 250,000 for their entire life expectancy ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
the head of aig a few years ago was making $ 250,000 every week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money , though . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not for you , but for most people it 's a lot of money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these executives , why do n't you tell ... |||O O O O O O O O O 
palmisano in california - wait , mr. nader . |||O O O O O O O O O 
why do n't you cap insurance ... |||O O O O O O O 
begala mr. palmisano , go ahead . |||O O O O O O O 
give me a moment , please . |||O O O O O O O 
in california where they have this law , it caps the non-economics , the ones you ca n't quantify . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are awards in 10 million , 20 million , $ 30 million in california for economic . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so all medicals , all rehabilitation , care services in the home , lost wages ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've got to ask mr. nader , we are almost out of time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
doug friedman ( ph ) , who ran jesse ventura 's campaign for governor four years ago , says he wants you to run for president again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know you 're saying it 's much too early to run for president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but one simple question , ralph , will you consider another run for president ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nader much too early to consider . |||O O O O O O O 
i am concerned about donald zook ( ph ) , who 's head of a medical malpractice insurance company , a big one in the west , saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame the tort injury system . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said that your problem of jacking up these insurance rates is self - inflicted . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here 's an insurance company executive who is saying that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , mr. zook is one executive you are quoting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
what we need to do is look at all of the people who do n't have doctors ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hey , let 's get some agreement . |||O O O O O O O O 
should we get some agreement ? |||O O O O O O 
do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
palmisano seventy percent of the cases filed are told there 's no payment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
what kind of peer review is that ? |||O O O O O O O O 
do you want to crack down on the bad doctors ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we definitely want to crack down on bad doctors . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
do you want to control insurance rates ? |||O O O O O O O O 
we want the free market to dictate what is done . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the free market actually dictates we have got to sell some commercials here on cnn or we 're all out of ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
interview with ralph nader , donald palmisano ; interview with congressmen j.d. hayworth , bernie sanders |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala welcome back to crossfire . |||O O O O O O 
over in iraq , arms inspectors are discovering and destroying missiles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
spy planes are searching for more banned arms , and iraqi scientists are being interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but here in washington , president bush says it 's all a hoax , and many believe he has already made up his mind to go to war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
back with us to talk about it , two congressmen : |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
j.d. hayworth , the republican from arizona , and bernie sanders , an independent from vermo nt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
novak congressman sanders , you 're opposed to this war . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
i 'm not crazy about it myself . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O 
but i want to ask you a question . |||O O O O O O O O O 
when the guns begin to fire , when the american men and women are in harm 's way and may be dying , is that now the time for you and your allies to shut up and support the troops ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well it 's not -- are you suggesting that when tens and thousands of iraqi women and children are killed , and when young men and women in this country are unnecessarily put at harm 's risk , what should we do ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the answer is , these are my neighbors from vermont and obviously we 're going to support them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and obviously we 're going to pray that there 's fewer casualties ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
are you going to demonstrate against them in the streets ? |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
no , i do n't demonstrate against anybody during a war . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
the president almost unilaterally is putting us in this position against world opinion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
novak did n't the congress support it ? |||O O O O O O O O 
i thought you voted for it . |||O O O O O O O 
i did not vote for it . |||O O O O O O O 
novak i mean the congress . |||O O O O O O 
the congress gave him authority , but the american people disagreed with the decision . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not according to the polls . |||O O O O O O 
not the polls that i have seen . |||O O O O O O O O 
begala congressman hayworth , back to a comment . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and i know that you meant it and i agreed with it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you said , " this is saddam hussein , the butcher of baghdad . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm curious , would that have accurately described him in 1988 ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think it has described him , especially since he 's taken basically a one - man rule over with the baath party in 1979 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
therefore , was n't dick cheney , as the ceo of halliburton , wrong to be selling oilfield equipment to the butcher of baghdad in 1988 ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hayworth i do n't know about any oil equipment going to saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what i do know in the here and now is ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i can tell you about it if you like . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and i know you 'd love to cloud the issue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's an important issue to me . |||O O O O O O O O 
no , it 's so important -- you know this -- and i know it 's fun and we love doing partisan punch & judy , but is there ever a time when we stand up even if we respectfully disagree with the commander in chief and those who would wage war ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
dissent is fine , but these cheap shots , i do n't know anything about halliburton . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he had $ 73 million worth of ( unintelligible ) to sell oilfield equipment to saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what i do know is saddam hussein has butchered over a million of his own citizens . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
and to somehow try to play partisan parlor games may be cute , but we are dealing with a clear and present danger . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala would you have treated him as a customer , the way dick cheney did ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hayworth i do n't even know about that . |||O O O O O O O O O 
would you have sold oilfield equipment to him ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
sanders furthermore , the united states supported him in the war against iran . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
seventy - nine americans were held hostage . |||O O O O O O O O 
what we 're talking about is the unpredictable nature of war and what could happen in this war . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
for example -- wait a second -- in iran , the reason that you had ayatollah khomeini in power is he overthrew the shah . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
you who put the shah in power ? |||O O B-TRI O O O O O 
the united states of america . |||O O O O O O 
oh the evil united states . |||O O O O O O 
novak i want to get to that point . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but the problem with khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O 
i ca n't quite figure that out . |||O O O O O O O O 
we overthrew ( unintelligible ) and put the shah of iran in power . |||O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
but i mean you 're attacking the cia for putting him in , when it was -- the problem was khomeini . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , the point i made , khomeini came about because we put a brutal dictator , the shah of iran , in power . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the point that i am making is you can not ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the point you 're making is blame america first . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you do n't know what happens when the most powerful nation on earth invades and occupies a muslim nation and kills tens of thousands of people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
bernie sanders , an independent from vermont , thank you very much . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
congressman j.d. hayworth , a republican from arizona , thank you both very much . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we will come back to this debate , believe me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of our viewers , though , thinks there 's a sure fire way to get that al qaeda ring leader to talk . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll let him fire back in a little bit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but next , out of all of the pictures from this weekend 's nail biter between j.d. hayworth 's alma mater of ( unintelligible ) state , and bob novak 's beloved university of maryland , only one photo is dramatic enough or politically charged enough to be the crossfire " picture of the day . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you do not want to miss this . |||O O O O O O O O 
interview with ralph nader , donald palmisano ; interview with congressmen j.d. hayworth , bernie sanders |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm christa demore ( ph ) from monrovia , maryland . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i 'm curious , how can democrats claim that president bush is ignoring the war on terror if al qaeda 's second key operative was just caught ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
and it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he can not eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i 'm still doubtful of -- no , here 's why . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a serious point and you deserve a serious answer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the way we caught that guy was by coordinating with our allies . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
we now have a foreign policy in iraq that is putting enormous strain on those allies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the same weekend they arrested the guy , we had ... |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
we had no part in it . |||O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
no , it was a joi nt effort by pakistan . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
why do we want to sever that relationship with this idiotic war in iraq ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
we 're not severing it -- question . |||O O O O O O O O 
ben charlton hi . i 'm ben charlton ( ph ) from east lansing , michigan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was -- if we wait for u.n. approval for action in iraq , do n't we sacrifice some of our national sovereignty ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , where are all of the conservative questions ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we never have conservatives in the audience . |||O O O O O O O O 
i think even paul would agree with me . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the question of whether we go to war or not is strictly a national question . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
it 's not a united nations question . |||O O O O O O O O 
the president has got all of the legal authorities he needs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i just pray to god he does n't use it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we need to go to the u.n. because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the world and so that we do n't have to carry the burden ourselves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but legally he has no obligation to go back to the u.n. from the left i am paul begala . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
from the right , i 'm robert novak . |||O O O O O O O O O 
join us next time for another edition of crossfire . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
look at latest evidence against iraq ; any hope u.n. , old europe will come around to bush administration 's way of thinking ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on this ash wednesday , the pope asks catholics to fast for peace and he asks president bush to work for peace , while the white house sends out colin powell to make yet another case for war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
we will debate all of that as well as " vanity fair " 's latest , stunning revelations about michael jackson . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
believe it or not , we got new news on michael jackson . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think he really looks like a mummy ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
but first , our own little moonwalk across the political landscape , the " crossfire political alert . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the foreign ministers of france , germany and russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second american - backed resolution to pass the united nations security council . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
president bush wants the security council to explicitly authorize force against iraq , and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end , that 's just what he 'll get . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
president bush is said to be focusing on one fence - sitting security council member , the african nation of guinea , because he said -- quote -- " i used to have one of their pigs . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so -- ok , i made that up . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but they are a swing vote . |||O O O O O O O 
guinea is an important swing vote . |||O O O O O O O 
france and germany are pointing to inspection and saying , look , they 're working . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're not pointing out that inspections are working only because there 's the credible threat of war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
saddam would n't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he did n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
begala i think that 's a good point . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it does n't mean we have to go to war . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
but i think president bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
it means when you take the threat of force of the table , you 're likely to stop disarming saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yes , i 'm not saying take the threat of force . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
i 'm saying we do n't need to use force right now . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
carlson well , france and germany would like to . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
secretary of state colin powell today responded to saddam hussein 's latest attempts to fool the world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
powell called iraqi steps toward disarmament -- quote -- " too little , too late " gestures , meant to split international resolve to force baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. intelligence said powell indicates iraq has hidden equipment to produce al - samoud 2 missiles , even as it destroys existing ones , missiles that until recently , it claimed not to have . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
powell also revealed that iraq is hiding chemical and biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in order to secure peace , powell concluded , the international community must confront saddam hussein 's refusal to disarm -- quote -- " here and now . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , there you have it . |||O O O O O O O 
the essence of the american case for war against saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the only question left : who do you believe ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
secretary of state colin powell or france ? |||O O O O O O O O 
who do you believe : the bush administration or your lying eyes ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are watching them destroy weapons , as the president says , oh , that 's just a hoax . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , no , no that 's not what the president 's saying . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's saying , the -- it 's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the weapons there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
keep in mind , these are weapons that saddam hussein , until recently , said he did n't even have . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and to trust saddam hussein in effort to disarm him -- foolish task , do n't you think ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the question is , is he a sufficient threat to america today to risk the lives of our young men and women . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's a very separate question . |||O O O O O O O 
begala i think he 's not . |||O O O O O O O 
i think the inspections can work . |||O O O O O O O 
we can take it up later . |||O O O O O O O 
look at latest evidence against iraq ; any hope u.n. , old europe will come around to bush administration 's way of thinking ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala well , those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this : msnbc , an obscure cable channel , has fired phil donahue , the host of its highest - rated show . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a memo from inside nbc , reported on the web site allyourtv.com , and today in " the washington post , " shows nbc big wigs feared that the liberal mr. donahue represented in the words of the nbc memo -- quote -- " a difficult public face for nbc at a time of war , while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war , anti-bush and skeptical of the administration 's motives . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so there it is , according to nbc . |||O O O O O O O O O 
phil donahue was fired because he 's a liberal . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
in fact , the only liberal with the solo cable talk show . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nbc , of course , is a division of the conglomerate ge , where they apparently only bring right wing things to life . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i actually like phil donahue . |||O O O O O O 
i 've interviewed him a number of times . |||O O O O O O O O O 
his arguments are really dumb . |||O O O O O O 
i do n't know if you 've listened to phil donahue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
delightful guy , but his arguments do n't make a lot of sense and i think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts -- you excluded , of course , and james . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the arguments , actually , do n't hold up very well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , you can argue back and forth , but you should n't fire someone because of their political views and that 's what nbc has done and shame on the general electric corporation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he had the highest - rated show on the network . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
carlson which is saying what ? |||O O O O O O 
begala i used to work there . |||O O O O B-TRI O O 
they 're very nice people and they 're very good to me ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carlson ok , ok , i 'm not beat up on msnbc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala ... but they should n't fire a guy for his political views . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
look at latest evidence against iraq ; any hope u.n. , old europe will come around to bush administration 's way of thinking ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carlson former illinois senator carol moseley - braun recently decided to run for president . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
early reviews have not been good , so yesterday she announced she 'll be making some changes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not to her ideas , which are few . |||O O O O O O O O O 
not to her record , which is pretty embarrassing . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
not even to her staff , which is , of course , tiny . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
from here on out , carol moseley - braun as carol moseley braun . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
did you catch the difference ? |||O O O O O O 
in the second version , there is no hyphen between her last names . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
moseley braun expects that primary voters in iowa and new hampshire will react enthusiastically to this radical , grammatical transformation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 'll have to , because the latest cnn poll shows moseley braun far behind the candidate she set out to discredit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that would be , of course , the honorable al sharpton . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sharpton is not only by far the first choice of black voters nationally , he is tied with senator john edwards among all voters and beating governor howard dean , representative dennis kucinich and senator bob graham . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and al sharpton did n't even have to change his name . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how did he become honorable ? |||O O O O O O 
you become honorable by winning an election of some sort or having a high post , being an ambassador or a governor or some thing . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
by embodying the values of your party . |||O O O O O O O O 
begala your values , not mine . |||O O O O O O O 
he 's the no. 1 pick , the most popular , among all candidates , among black primary voters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , you ca n't dismiss him . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we have n't even begun the primaries . |||O O O O O O O O 
he 's not a serious candidate . |||O O O O O O O 
he 's right wing fantasy and it 's never going to happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
al sharpton seriously , that 's our message tonight . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
in a moment , we 'll ask two members of congress if they 're convinced that war is the only way to make saddam hussein disarm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
later , the pope practices religion and a little anti-war politics on the side . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
then , can you spell prosthetic nose ? |||O O O O O O O O 
maureen orth can , and she does in a new " vanity fair " profile of michael jackson . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you wo n't want to miss that . |||O O O O O O O O 
look at latest evidence against iraq ; any hope u.n. , old europe will come around to bush administration 's way of thinking ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carlson welcome back to crossfire . |||O O O O O O 
france , russia and germany today restated their opposition to any new u.n. security council that could threaten saddam hussein 's grip on power . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
secretary of state colin powell goes to the u.n. tomorrow to do what he can . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're talking with potential war in iraq with congressman charlie rangel , a new york democrat and his fellow new yorker republican congressman peter king . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala mr. king , thanks for stying with us through the break . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of the reasons that we like having you on , and as well as mr. rangel , is that , you know , this is war , as we were saying in the last segment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
you treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and you 're a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i wonder if you 'll join charlie rangel , who put out a press release today , decrying the republican attempt to hijack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is n't that wrong in a time of war ? |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
the important thing is that the bill pass for the military . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the other stuff 's in there , it 's there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean to me , the main purpose should be the military . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not going to disagree with charlie 's point . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the other hand , often when bills are passed , there are things attached to them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so to me , the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the military and that 's what we should do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carlson congressman rangel , a couple of months ago senator daschle on cbs said -- made the charge that we are , quote , " we have n't made any real progress in the war against al qaeda . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
a lot of democrats said similar things . |||O O O O O O O O 
this weekend khalid shaikh mohammed , the no. 2 member of al qaeda and another significant al qaeda member were captured in rawalpindi , pakistan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
does n't it turn out that mr. daschle and others did n't know what they were talking about and maybe they should n't make charges like that in public when they do n't know what they were talking about ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you would agree with that , would n't you ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
if they do n't have the pencil that 's keeping score , they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor , every drug dealer i busted was the most important drug dealer in the world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you just pass out numbers on whoever you arrest . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
because he helped plan the attack on the world trade center and the pentagon ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
i think that puts you pretty high up in the organization . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let me tell you , when you arrest somebody , you describe who you 're arresting . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
i have n't the slightest clue who this guy was . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have n't heard anybody suggest that he 's not one of the central figures in al qaeda . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rangel listen , we should be arresting a lot of people . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
but i think the main thing that we have now is we should concentrate on osama bin laden , we should concentrate on dismantling saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we should do all of those things , but the most important thing is we should not have the arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nation without the ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
and how 'd they get them ? |||O O O O B-TRI O O 
rangel listen , if this is ... |||O O O O O O O 
it was our fault that they have biological and chemical weapons ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have it and we supported them having it when they were fighting iran so it 's no big deal there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
and the thing is that if we can disarm them without actually going there , killing them , i really think that we maintain our moral authority around the world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have a lot of people ... |||O O O O O O O 
rangel ... that have dangerous weapons . |||O O O O O O O 
i mean , what happens if india decides that they could have a preemptive strike against pakistan ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
what happens if the north koreans take another look ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
our country is great enough and strong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince the international community that we 're right . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think we have to kill to prove that . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
begala i 'm sorry to have to do this , but we are out of time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i want have congressman peter king from new york back on , and congressman charlie rangel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thank you both for a very interesting debate . |||O O O O O O O O O 
one of the most admired men in the world is doing everything he can to avert the horror of war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
in a minute we will look at his holiness , john paul ii 's efforts to be a peacemaker . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
later , the author of " vanity fair 's " scary new look at the king of pop , michael jackson . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you will not want to miss this . |||O O O O O O O O 
look at latest evidence against iraq ; any hope u.n. , old europe will come around to bush administration 's way of thinking ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala welcome back to crossfire . |||O O O O O O 
maybe it 's just me , but i think michael jackson , he 's kooky , wacky . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
time now for " fireback , " where our wacky and kooky fans and friends and critics right in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
don from denver , colorado writes , " paul , you keep referencing halliburton selling equipment to iraq " -- which i do . |||O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" i recall , as reported in ' the wall street journal , ' that the transactions were legal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is it possible that the equipment allowed iraq to produce oil for the oil for food program authorized by the u.n. ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they were legal because mr. cheney 's company used a loophole . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they went through a foreign subsidiary . |||O O O O O O O 
but they did enrich saddam hussein and his evil , ruthless regime , and they were immoral . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dick cheney should have never profited off of doing business with saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would agree with that . |||O O O O O O 
what does that have to do with the war in iraq ? |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
it means cheney is a hypocrite . |||O O O O O O O 
he 's trying to lead us into a war against one of his valued customers . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
that 's irrelevant to the argument . |||O O O O O O O 
begala i 'm attacking his business practices . |||O O O O O O O O 
no , no , you 're attacking -- ok great . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but it has nothing to do whether we should go to war with iraq or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
well yesterday he was a valued customer , today he 's an even villain . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so we 're against dick cheney , but that does n't have anything to do with saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
chad hensley , from fairfax , virginia , writes , " france , russia and german have all multi-billion dollar oil deals with saddam in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i wonder why they protest the war with iraq . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
it must be the humanitarian reasons . " |||O O O O O O O O 
well , chad , that 's what liberals assume . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
that europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds , but the u.s. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
it is a weird assumption , do n't you think ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
as you know , i 've never said that . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i think it 's unwise , it 's unjust , it 's unwarranted , but i do n't think it 's about oil . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , the reason that france , russia and germany are against war is because they have democracies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the people are against it . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
those leaders are reflecting the views of their people . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
look at latest evidence against iraq ; any hope u.n. , old europe will come around to bush administration 's way of thinking ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my name is christina wright ( ph ) . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and i was just curious if you feel that the attack on iraq would actually open a pandora 's box in other middle eastern countries that we are known to aid and harbor terrorists , such as syria and iran . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean that 's absolutely one of the fears . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
that it would destabilize the entire region . |||O O O O O O O O 
on the other hand , the region is pretty unstable , filled with people who already hate americans and seek to do america harm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
so the question is , could it be worse ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect of democracy through the region . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think he 's thought it through . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i think it 's more likely that this very unstable region could cause even more problems . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
fabian hi . i 'm fabian from bonn , germany . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and my question is , after today 's meeting in paris , where france , russia and germany decided to not back a second resolution , who is not ( unintelligible ) ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is it the u.s. or is it old europe ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's actually western europe , because 18 european countries are on the side of the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so france and germany -- that 's actually true -- find themselves in the minority on their own continent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala only great britain is with us . |||O O O O O O O O 
what do you mean only great britain ? |||O O O O O O O O 
my question is not who votes at the u.n . who sends troops to die on our side ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
from the left , i am paul begala . |||O O O O O O O O O 
from the right , i 'm tucker carlson . |||O O O O O O O O O 
join us again tomorrow night for yet more crossfire . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
iraq blames market blast on coalition |||O O O O O O 
we know that some of the american troops now fighting in iraq are longtime veterans of warfare , probably not most , but some . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
their military service goes back to the vietnam era . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
so what is it like for them to face combat far from home ? |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
for an idea , here is cnn 's candy crowley with some war stories . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
candy crowley , cnn sr . political correspondent ( voice - over ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are , we are told , well trained . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a messy business . |||O O O O O O 
there 's nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat , because it is to kill people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O 
in the spring of 1970 , a squad of u.s. soldiers spotted a small unit of viet cong that had been circling for days . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
staff sergeant tom ridge opened fire . |||O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
a viet cong soldier dropped dead . |||O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
did you at the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
tom ridge , homeland security secretary mm-hmm . |||O O O O O O O O 
that 's one of those introspective times where it 's just -- it 's just an introspective time , not a public time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
duke cunningham was a vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
after his first , he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering , shaking his hand , pushing in to slap his back . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and one of the guys looked at me and says : duke , what 's it like to kill somebody ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and , all of a sudden , bang , it just hit me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you do n't think about those things . |||O O O O O O O O 
and i went to the priest , because it bothered me . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i knew i could do it again . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O 
but i did n't know it was going to bother me as much as it did . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
of all the wounds time does not heal , the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's not something that civilized people do . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you do n't -- it 's just not -- it 's not a matter of being tormented , but troubled in the sense that that 's not what we do , unless we 're called upon to do it , under the most extreme set of circumstances . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
war may sometimes be a necessary thing , but it can never be a natural thing . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
sergeant chuck hagel was seriously wounded twice in vietnam . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
you are trying to kill people , because the alternative is , if you are in combat , you will be killed . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
so your choices are not varied . |||O O O O O O O 
and so you do what you 're trained to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
you do what you 're there to do . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and , in vietnam , it was body count . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you , going the other way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
charles rangel ( d ) , new york |||O O O O O O O O 
it 's hard to explain what training can do . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment , but to training . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you really do n't have time to think : i 'm going the wrong way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i should be going the other way . |||O O O O O O O O 
crowley later , when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in korea , staff sergeant charlie rangel led 40 men , fighting their way to safety . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
he won a bronze star. |||O O O O O 
if you 're killing people , it 's out of fear , not really , in my opinion , out of bravery . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nobody is looking for medals . |||O O O O O O 
everyone wants to live another day . |||O O O O O O O 
rangel , cunningham , ridge and hagel are all proud , decorated combat veterans . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
it 's just , a decade later , killing still troubles the soul . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
maybe that 's a good thing . |||O O O O O O O 
did you do it again ? |||O O O B-TRI O O 
i shot down four more migs . |||O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
and i often told myself -- i said that , if i ever get used to this , i should n't be here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
remarkable interviews and a reminder that what these men and women are going through right now in iraq , they will remember for the rest of their lives . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's our coverage this hour . |||O O O O O O O

we have just watched multitudes of warplanes land , multitudes of warplanes take off and this may be the busiest night of the campaign . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're expecting a total at this particular base near the iraqi border of 300 sorties in a 24 - hour period ending today according to the air force total from all the bases and there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the middle east according to the pentagon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're saying there will be 1500 sorties in a 24 - hour period ending tomorrow . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
eight hundred of those sorties will be strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over iraq . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's a lot of bombs and missiles . |||O O O O O O O O O

we 'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly for late edition on sunday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , as coalition forces push north , they are encountering a unique problem of combat , getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
some of the 40,000 british troops are kicking up a lot of dust in the iraqi desert making sure that nothing is left behind them that could hurt them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
greg milam is with the u.k. forces in southern iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
seemingly deserted , these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to british forces in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sergea nt geoff banham , royal engineers |||O O O O O O O 
this is what we 're coming across a lot of these , 30 mil , 60 mil , 80 mil , even 120 mil . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so there 's plenty still out there that will have to be recovered because they can be used . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you know when this place was last used ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean do you know ( unintelligible ) |||O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not too sure but judging by some of this , it 's been here quite a long time so whether it 's been used recently by them - there was an intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
milam grenades , mortars , all sorts of ammunition abandoned by iraqi soldiers but there for the taking . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the job of these royal engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the rest is carried way out into the desert . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and today 's parts in this conflict , this kind of work becomes more and more important . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
with the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
captain andy gooch , royal engineers |||O O O O O O 
with the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about , if they 'd used those systems , that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no one in the british forces here is willing to take any risks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
greg milam , sky news , southern iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O 
new explosions in mosul , baghdad |||O O O O O O 
that 's something to look at . |||O O O O O O O 
today the pentagon is comparing suicide bombing attacks on coalition forces in iraq to terrorism . |||O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
four u.s. army soldiers were killed when a suicide bomber attacked a military checkpoint today in najaf . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
plante is chasing all that down for us at the pentagon right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
chris plante , cnn pentagon correspondent |||O O O O O O 
four u.s. soldiers from the 3rd infantry division manning a checkpoint near the town of najaf killed today in an apparent suicide bombing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI B-TRI I-TRI 
a man driving what appeared to be a taxicab came to the checkpoint , waved soldiers over , appeared to be having mechanical problems of some kind . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as the soldiers approached , the man detonated explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
this is something that iraqi vice president ramadan had said would take place . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said this long before the conflict ever began . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
he reiterated today in a press conference in baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of u.s. troops with suicide bombing similar to this . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI B-TRI O O O O 
also , in southern iraq today near basra , two members - claimed to be members of saddam 's thataeen ( ph ) group surrendered to u.s. troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings down there but that they did n't want to die for the regime so they were surrendering . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
at the pentagon briefing today , general stanley mcchrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
it looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this , it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics , techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it wo n't change our overall rules of engagement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it does n't effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so certainly an unpleasant development today judy and another item on the docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern mediterranean and in the red sea have suffered a number of failures . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have failed crashing in turkey and in saudi arabia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the missiles are programmed so that they do n't detonate until they reach their target . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if they go astray , then the warheads never arm but claiming that it 's about one percent of the warheads . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 've fired 675 or so tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
woodruff chris , very quickly , new information from the pentagon today about any concerns they have about saddam hussein 's ongoing air defense capability ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
plante well , no major concern . |||O O O O O O O 
the pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the reason that they 're still in tact according to today 's briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they do n't turn them on , the u.s. has trouble locating them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radars that they 'll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airspace over baghdad.judy ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're paying attention to all those details for us , chris plante at the pentagon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 're looking at live pictures of baghdad where there have been more strikes , more bombs dropped , more missiles this evening and of course as always , cnn keeping a close eye , a close watch , a close listen on what 's going on in baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coming up , coalition forces control several parts of southern iraq but they still face some serious problems including pockets of resistance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that story when we come back . |||O O O O O O O 
since marching into iraq , coalition troops have engaged in some fierce battles with saddam hussein 's forces . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
a serious problem they still face though , pockets of resistance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter david bowden is with the british forces in umm qasr in southern iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
new explosions in mosul , baghdad |||O O O O O O 
david bowden , cnn correspondent house clearance royal marine style , troops from ( unintelligible ) commando task to seek out the last pockets of iraqi resistance in umm qasr go in hard to arrest suspected regime sympathizers and search for weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
it 's not pretty and there 's no please and thank you but for the marines , every door potentially hides a gunman and when your life is on the line , manners go out the window . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the iraqis arrested looked bemused ( ph ) and plead innocence but with many militia here , pretending to surrender only to open fire on their captors later , first impressions can be deceptive and lethal . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this patrol did find hidden weapons . |||O O O O O O O 
they 're not the first and they 're unlikely to be the last . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the marines believe they have a firm hold on umm qasr right now but they ca n't afford to slack in their grip and allow those who are hostile to the coalition forces to regroup and begin again their cycle of violence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the marines with their snipers have now snipers have now spread their area of operations north to include the town of umm kiou ( ph ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as in umm qasr before it , they 're here to clear out the opponents to regime change . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a man in this vehicle took a pot shot at the commandos . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
it was a painful and bloody mistake . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O 
major rob macgowan , royal marines |||O O O O O O 
we sent in one of our companies of about 100 men in here this morning and we took about 12 or 13 prisoners , three or four enemy were injured and they 've now been flown out and we 're treating them including a man who is almost dead with a gunshot wound to the chest . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI B-TRI O O O O 
we 've now evacuated them out and the enemy now have either fled or they 've been captured . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the royal marines are satisfied they are in control of this small corner of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
their task now is to keep it that way . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
david bowden in southern iraq . |||O O O O O O 
new explosions in mosul , baghdad |||O O O O O O 
that report filed just a short time ago . |||O O O O O O O O O 
well , cnn analyst ken pollack who is with the center for middle east policy at the brookings institution is with me now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he is an expert on the iraqi military and its tactics and weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ken pollack , that resistance that we just saw the british troops dealing with , you and i were talking earlier today . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you 're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ken pollack , center for middle east policy , brookings institution right . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean we 're seeing one of the great advantages of u.s. and british forces now , judy , which is that they 're superbly trained troops . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have training in a whole variety of different missions and they 're adapting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it , risks to the supply line , risks in terms of not clearing cities and they 're shifting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 've seen u.s. central command bringing up additional forces like the 82nd airborne division to better deal with these long supply lines , get control over the cities and so i think that u.s. and british forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so as an onlooker , as somebody who 's studied the iraqi capabilities , is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of the things i think we 're likely to see is that the iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than u.s. forces are . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
typically what you 've seen in the iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it does n't come from the ground up . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you do n't have ground commanders calling back and saying hey , we 'd like to try this tactic or this seems to work . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tell everybody else to do the same thing . |||O O O O O O O O O 
instead the high command has to identify a problem , come up with a solution and transmit it down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
chances are the iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we 've seen before , irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack u.s. forces , some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's no way around that but u.s. forces , british forces are beginning to adapt to it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting more support from ordinary iraqi people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i just interviewed a gentleman , native of iraq , who talks to his family there all the time and he says they live in baghdad 20 , 30 , 50 of them and he said they do the view the americans as invaders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they do n't like what he 's doing but they do n't think the americans are the answer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , this is something that we 've been trying to get a grip on for years , exactly what the iraqi people feel and also that i think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that iraqis do , they despise . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
they are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token , they do n't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that , i think it 's probably most important for most iraqis is they 're deeply suspicious of the united states . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they remember that the united states betrayed them in 1991 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the u.s. did n't finish saddam then . |||O O O O O O O O 
president bush - then president bush called on them to rise up and then the u.s. did nothing and so they 're deeply suspicious of what we have in mind . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
woodruff which raises questions going forward . |||O O O O O O O 
one last thing , ken pollack i want to ask about this british officials saying that they have information that saddam hussein has fired his air defense chief . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
what 's the significance of that ? |||O O O O O O O 
well , if it 's true and obviously we do n't know just yet but if it 's true , it is very significant because it 's effectively the iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we 've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
exactly , in that market and i think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market , if that had been a u.s. bomb or a u.s. cruise missile , that market would have been obliterated . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
chances are it was an iraqi surface to air missile . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
new explosions in mosul , baghdad |||O O O O O O 
we 're going to go quickly to northern iraq now where we find cnn correspondent ben wedeman . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's been some action in that area . |||O O O O O O O O O 
nick ( ph ) - i mean - i 'm sorry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ben , we can make you out just barely but tell us what you 've been seeing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ben wedeman , cnn correspondent yes . |||O O O O O O O 
judy , you 're seeing us through the night scope because basically for the last hour we 've been watching as this ridge behind me in kalak which of course is the front line between iraq and kurdish ( ph ) forces , we 've been watching as planes , planes we can hear but can not see , have been bombing the ridge line behind us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the iraqi positions behind us . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
not just iraqi positions behind us , in addition to that in the direction of mosul as well which is a major northern iraqi city about 28 miles to the west of me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
ben , what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that the coalition forces are going after there ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wedeman well , basically on the ridge itself it is the most forward iraqi army positions and we 've been watching them very closely for the last month prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are the positions that control this entire valley . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
up there they have heavy machine guns . |||O O O O O O O O 
they have anti-tank guns , hundreds of men along this very long ridge that basically runs from the north to the south . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in addition to that , we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well , this according to the people here in this area , the local kurds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
now precisely what they 're hitting to the south of us is unclear but my understanding is that there are further iraqi positions in that direction as well . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wedeman ben wedeman describing coalition hits in the area where he is , the town of kalak in northern iraq . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he just called in and we wanted to get this report to you right away . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ben , very - we thank you very much for that and we 'll be coming back to you as the night - as the night wears on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're getting close to the bottom of the hour . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're going to get some headlines at the hour right now with heidi collins . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
new explosions in mosul , baghdad |||O O O O O O 
i hope they get a little rest . |||O O O O O O O O 
when we come back , one of the many sad aspects of this war , humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it but not everybody gets what they came for . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
slowly humanitarian aid is rolling into southern iraq but dramatic scenes like this one of a crowd tearing into the supplies on a convoy truck only underscores how desperate the need is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
correspondent martin geissler files this report from the iraqi town of safwan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as our convoy rolled through southern iraq the desperation of the people here soon became evident . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in trucks and on foot they came to the town of safwan . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
these people have been without food or water supplies since the war began . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
within seconds the kuwaiti aid workers who had organized this trip were overpowered by the mob . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these desperate scenes are exactly what the aide agencies wanted to avoid . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is survival of the fittest . |||O O O O O O O 
only the healthy and strong can get to the food . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the weak and the ill are left with nothing . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
despite this effort to help the iraqi people , resentment is never far away . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we hate u.s. we hate british , england . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we hate any state in war here . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O 
what do you think about saddam 's regime ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
unidentified male saddam 's very good man . |||O O O O O O O O 
as the supplies ran out the mood swung from frantic to ugly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of the buses in our convoy was held up at knifepoint . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
the troops have moved into safwan . |||O O O B-TRI O O O 
we , as a consequence , have had to move out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a clear indication that despite the coalition reassurances that this part of iraq is safe and despite the aid being brought into the people here , it is still a very , very volatile area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tonight here the strong are eating . |||O O O O O O O 
the weak still go hungry . |||O O O O O O

here in the united states this weekend just as they did last weekend , anti-war protesters taking to the street . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
in los angeles , the international black coalition for peace and justice is sponsoring a rally for peace today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
congresswoman maxine waters was among those scheduled to attend . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
in the meantime further north in california , san francisco is the setting today for a rally aimed at boosting the moral of the american troops in the persian gulf region . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
cnn 's rusty dornin is with us from san francisco . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
rusty , what sort of crowd is showing up there ? |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O 
well judy , this is the largest group really we 've seen of the support the troops rallies that have been over the last few weeks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
of course this is the home of the anti - war demonstrations stemming back to the vietnam war but there are close to between 500 and 1,000 people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm getting various estimates on the crowd . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we did want to show you an interesting thing here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
some folks are showing some solidarity with the speakers here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 're looking at some of san francisco 's police department 's officers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did ask them why they did that . |||O O O O O O O O O 
they said they were wearing skullcaps so they decided to adopt this to show solidarity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they said the department has not made any statement about whether they think that 's all right or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this has been a very peaceful demonstration . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
as i said , the officers did tell me that this is the largest pro-troops demonstration that has ever been in san francisco since the vietnam war . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
as i said , there have been a few verbal exchanges but one of the most enthusiastically received speakers here was bessam al - husaini , an iraqi american . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's with the iraqi american council . |||O O O O O O O O 
how do you feel about supporting the troops ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
how does the iraqi american council feel ? |||O O O O O O O O 
bessam al - husaini , iraqi american council |||O O O O O O O O 
well the iraqi american have been waiting for this liberation and they want to get rid of saddam so bad and they will have to take it the way it 's been offered to us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings ? |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI I-TRI 
we get reports that these civilians especially in the ( inaudible ) population have been attacked by the iraqi regime themselves so they ca n't blame the american and said look what the american doing to us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he would love to see this and would draw on this emotion from the arab world and the european country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now you said you did talk to your family in baghdad as well and they also are somewhat suspicious of the americans . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
al - husaini well , i mean the iraqi people have been the primary victim from the whole thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah my family , you know , still in fear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know they stay in one room . |||O O O O O O O O 
they boarded all the - all the windows and they built with a brick one of the windows facing the street . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean yes , you know , my prayer to them but we can only do so much . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hopefully it will be a short war . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
it will be attack the iraqi regime . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O 
we can live in liberty and freedom soon . |||O O O O O O O O O 
now i understand some of the people here have been threatened by anti-war protesters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
have you had anyone either threatening you or ... |||O O O O O O O O O 
this has been a very peaceful demonstration . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
dornin bessam al - husaini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
it is wrapping up this afternoon and it looks like the civil disobedience acts by the anti-protesters are scheduled to get underway once again next week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
new explosions in mosul , baghdad |||O O O O O O 
it was in northern iraq today that an eight artillery round hit the site occupied by kurdish fighters near chamchamal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
it happened near an area abandoned earlier by iraqi forces . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
cnn 's kevin sites is in northern iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O 
this is the road to kirkuk . |||O O O O O O O 
a day ago it was controlled by iraqi troops and packed with these land mines but now we can drive far enough to see the outskirts of kirkuk . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
that 's because coalition fighter jets pummeled this iraqi position on the hills above chamchamal and iraqi troops made a hasty retreat . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
this is what the hilltop looks like now , craters 15 feet deep , busted bunkers and twisted metal , scattered ammunitions and tattered clothing , a helmet , a tube of toothpaste . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kurdish peshmerga fighters took their place . |||O O O O O O O 
i 'm glad to see them go this one says . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
they killed a lot of our people in chamchamal but i feel bad for them too . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some of them were only conscripts . |||O O O O O O O 
some kurds took advantage of the iraqi retreat right away . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
this one took a bulldozer to a concrete portrait of saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it took about 20 minutes but finally it came toppling down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he says after finishing the job he hopes saddam hussein himself will fall too but despite the exuberance of kurds in the area , it 's clear it 's much too early to celebrate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although the iraqis retreated from this area , at dusk they fired what observers say were seven artillery rounds back at their former stronghold creating new fear and potentially new casualties . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
kevin sites , cnn chamchamal northern iraq . |||O O O O O O O O 
all right and when we return , waiting here on the home front , a very special reunion between a marine and his wife . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there is no greater gap probably than that between the troops overseas and their loved ones here at home . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
cnn helped bridge that cassum ( ph ) at least temporarily between sergeant craig martin of the 15th marine expeditionary unit and his wife kaycee martin in california . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they talked by videophone this morning . |||O B-TRI O O O O O 
you 're eight months pregnant i believe . |||O O O O O O O O 
how has this been for you ? |||O O O O O O O 
kaycee martin , wife of soldier |||O O O O O O 
i 'm doing ok but it would be much better if he was home with me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if i could just ask , i mean and you know i do n't want to pry so anytime i ask something you do n't want to say just tell me to shut up but what is it like for you watching all this coverage ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean watching , you know , the access . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the pictures were seeing are really historic in what we are able to see . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is it more - does it make it more difficult ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
does it make it easier ? |||O O O O O O 
the whole time though you 're just sitting there trying to catch a glimpse just to see if maybe one of the people on tv is him but you know he tells me do n't watch , do n't watch . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , it 's going to be difficult but like i said , it 's just too hard . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i want to be able to see just to make sure that he 's ok , just catch a glimpse of him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how does he look to you right now ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
he looks all right , but dirty . |||O O O O O O O O 
sgt . craig martin , 15th marine expeditionary unit i lost my tooth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how 'd you - how 'd you lose your tooth ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
how did you lose your tooth ? |||O O O O O O O 
when we came across the bridge , the enemy launched some 155 artillery rounds at us . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
it came pretty close and the concussion knocked my tooth out . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
it does n't sound like you 're being too careful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know if you see , your wife 's sort of shaking her head . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
c. martin careful as i can be . |||O O O O O O O O 
cooper sergeant martin , is there anything else ... |||O O O O O O O O O 
is there anything else you would like to say either to your wife or to all the people who are watching this ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know this awkward , you know , doing this on tv and i hate to put you in this position but feel free . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've got a couple of things real quick . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
to my old man , this is not a distraction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
to my wife , we 'll be home soon and i love you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's all i 've got to say . |||O O O O O O O O O 
well that says a lot . |||O O O O O O 
kaycee , anything else you want to say ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
i love you very much . |||O O O O O O 
i miss you very much . |||O O O O O O 
everyone is praying for you and i just want you to come home safe and soon so you could see our new baby . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one more thing , you look really beautiful right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'd like to say the same to you . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
martin well , just come home soon . |||O O O O O O O O 
c. martin without a doubt . |||O O O O O O 
k . martin --- well , just come home soon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
a little embarrassing for us to watch . |||O O O O O O O O 
it 's got to be difficult talking to your loved one in front of thousands and thousands of people on television , millions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , in addition to the baby on the way , the martins also have a three - year - old daughter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that is it for this hour . |||O O O O O O O O 
i 'm judy woodruff in washington . |||O O O O O O O 
wolf blitzer 's report starts right now . |||O O O O O O O O 
the situation here appears to be increasingly tense . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a few moments ago , out on the horizon , not very far ahead of the u.s. army 's 3rd squadron , 7th cavalry , we heard more than a few explosions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the u.s. army 's 3rd squadron , 7th cavalry has compiled a rather extraordinary record in the past several days . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was the first unit to cross the euphrates river and then punch northward to within 60 miles of baghdad . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
it was the army which assigned me to the 3rd squadron , 7th cavalry , and that was extremely fortuitous . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was like sitting in a poker game and drawing four aces , because this is a crack unit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's the tip of the tip of the spear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've had an absolutely terrific story , pushing forward north toward baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
seventy - two hours of that was under constant fire coming at us from both sides of the road . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
we just heard an incoming -- what the hell ! |||O O O O O O O O O O 
no , no , i do n't know what it is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
recall winston churchill 's old quote , " there 's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at and missed . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
what you try to do is stay calm and continue your broadcasting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the worst thing you can do , either as a soldier or as a war correspondent is panic . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're not sure what it is . |||O O O O O O O O 
we see some stuff in the sky . |||O O O O O O O O 
we may have to break this off . |||O O O O O O O O 
i think we 're going to break off this live shot for the time being . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're not sure what we see up there . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've got to dive for vehicles , we think . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have under heavy fire for the past couple of miles . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
mostly small arms fire , but the sand storm has enabled the iraqis to come very close to the road , and if i sound a little nervous , it 's because we 're in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'd like to now show you what we call old betsy ( ph ) , a re-used , secondhand u.s. army humvee that we 've been traveling with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
any bullet will pass through it , even a .22 caliber bullet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can see our body armor draped on the door . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is what we 've literally been living in . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
this is the kitchen , when we 're down , and we 're very fortunate , because we 've got a teapot . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's extraordinary cramped , because ( unintelligible ) sandbag the floor , in case we hit a mine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's all the space i have to eat and sleep in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you really do n't sleep out here . |||O O O O O O O O 
of course , you 're on an adrenaline high , but racing across the desert , you know that you 're traveling toward the jaws of what could be a major military battle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
you have to realize , they 've been riding along , bouncing along in these tanks for probably six or more hours now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and if you ride inside that tank , it is like riding in the bowels of a dragon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the hardest part of the trip is personal discomfort . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we can not tell you the levels of personal discomfort we 've experienced . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the extraordinary sandstorms , the bitter cold nights . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the most uncomfortable thing is having to sleep sitting up in a humvee with sandbags under your feet , your knees at your chin . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's excruciatingly uncomfortable , not something that you would wish on anybody but a contortionist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let me give you an example of what the dust like . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have been through days of dust like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the u.s. army 's 7th cavalry has just taken three iraqi prisoners of war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
actually , they 're very close , that is to say , no more than 40 yards away , but the dust and sand are blowing so badly you 're getting these vague images . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's like being in a blizzard , except unfortunately , the sand does n't melt as the snow does . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what we eat is what the army calls mres , meals ready to eat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i must say , they 're pretty darn good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and of course , everybody fights for the best ones . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the treats are things like the m& ms and the breakfast toasties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the army is eating much , much better than the grandfathers of these soldiers did and the great grandfathers of these soldiers in the second world war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let me hold the camera and show you my crew . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
on camera left is charlie miller ( ph ) , he 's been our superb and intrepid cameraman . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on my right is jeff barweis ( ph ) , a brilliant satellite engineer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's the crew which really brings you these pictures . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the pictures you 're seeing are absolutely phenomenal . |||O O O O O O O O O 
these are live pictures of the 7th cavalry racing across the desert . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 've never seen battlefield pictures like these before . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
what you 're watching here is truly historic television and journalism . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
crowley walter rodgers with the 3-7th . |||O O O O O O O 
just ahead we 'll have the latest on today 's suicide bombing in israel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a report from cnn 's kelly wallace when we return . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we will be back later on the war in iraq . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
but first , we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in israel in three weeks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
wallace reports on today 's attack in netanya . |||O O O O O O O O O 
kelly wallace , cnn correspondent ( on camera ) |||O O O O O O O O O 
it had been very quiet inside israel since the start of the u.s. - led war against iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
many israelis were fearing that quiet would come to an end . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and it did on this day . |||O O O O O O O 
police say a suicide bomber blew himself up outside this cafe , called the london cafe , earlier sunday afternoon . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we can show you some pictures from earlier sunday . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
people here tell us the cafe was filled with people enjoying the spring weather . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
many here though say they are relieved only one person dead , the suicide bomber . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
dozens , though , injured , including some israeli soldiers , because according to an eyewitness , he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring weather . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then it was big bomb . |||O O O O O O 
two soldiers were down here . |||O O O O O O 
many people skip from here . |||O O O O O O 
there had been many terrorist attacks here in netanya , including the deadliest suicide bombing ever in israel almost exactly a year ago , march 27 , at the park hotel during passover , 29 people killed in that attack . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI I-TRI 
as for this attack , the palestinian militant group islamic jihad is claiming responsibility . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
according to a leaflet from the group obtained by cnn , the group says the attack was to show the union of palestinians with the people of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the group is also claiming that islamic jihad militants are already inside iraq to carry out attacks against u.s. and british forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
israel has been on a heightened state of alert since the start of the u.s. - led war against iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
and now many israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against saddam hussein continues . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O

well , at the pentagon briefing this afternoon , officials describing several units of the republican guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
let 's get the very latest from the pentagon for the overall war picture as they see it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
our jamie mcintyre our senior military affairs correspondent is with us now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well judy , the pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it had n't seen for awhile . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
first of all , as we saw just a few moments ago on cnn , the pictures of some of the actual happy iraqi citizens welcoming u.s. troops , that taking place in najaf . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also the pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those republican guard divisions before the u.s. troops arrived , both in karbala and also in al kut . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
they met lighter than expected resistance . |||O O O O O O O 
but the pentagon officials stress that as they close in on baghdad , this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so - called red zone where saddam hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons , and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the pentagon . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
major general stanley mcchrystal , joi nt chiefs , vice dir . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are not expecting to drive into baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de mains , or anything like that . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , in regard to that , we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
they may just suddenly be effective on the ground . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
additionally , their ability to use chemical and biological weapons , they 've proven it historically . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
we believe they have the capability now . |||O O O O O O O O 
clearly , as we threaten the core of the regime , which baghdad and tikrit represent , we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
in less than 24 hours , the u.s. 101st airborne division has driven iraqi fedayeen fighters from the key city of najaf , pushed north in a several - pronged attack . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
the army 's 3rd infantry has punched through karbala , meeting only light resistance from the medina republican guard , and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of baghdad . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the same time , the marines from the 1st division have secured a key tigris river crossing near al kut and reported to have essentially destroyed the combat fighting ability of that light infantry baghdad division that was supposed to be providing defense down there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the u.s. central command briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in doha , qatar , general vincent brooks said that the u.s. would be continuing to approach baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said , quote , " the dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime now , and it will remain pointed at it , " he said , " until the regime is gone . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O 
woodruff jamie , these descriptions of the weakening of the republican guard begin to bring back memories of the first gulf war 12 years ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
is there a chance that coalition forces could , at this point , be overestimating the strength of what 's left of the opposition ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that might be a good thing . |||O O O O O O O O 
they are taking it very cautiously . |||O O O O O O O 
no one , again , they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
could be a very dangerous time . |||O O O O O O O 
they also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed , they do n't mean every single person has been killed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
simply that it s combat effectiveness has been eliminated - judy . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
we notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed , in fact , they said let others do that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

woodruff well , rescued american prisoner of war jessica lynch is expected to arrive at ramstein air base in germany just about an hour from now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
cnn will have live coverage of her arrival . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
lynch was rescued in a daring raid by u.s. forces on the saddam hospital in nasiriya . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
this nightscope video shows troops carrying the 19 - year - old army private to a blackhawk helicopter . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we know , though , that 11 bodies were also recovered in this operation , and military officials say they are working now to identify them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when she 's in germany , lynch will be treated for bullet wounds and broken bones . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
she 's reported to be in stable condition . |||O O O O O O O O O 
she and more than a dozen other members of her army maintenance unit were ambushed near nasiriya more than a week ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
woodruff meantime in palestine , west virginia , there is a lot of joy over the news of jessica lynch 's rescue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
her father , mother and other family members say they never gave up hope , despite their fears of what might have happened . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they say they are grateful to her rescuers . |||O O O O O O O O O O

i ca n't really say how the military is functioning over there because i 'm not there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but they are doing a job , you know , i do n't know the thoughts of the soldiers , the men and women that went into that building and brought her out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O 
they are heroes in my book . |||O O O O O O O 
woodruff west virginia 's united states senator robert byrd is also praising the rescue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

she was rescued in a daring effort by the brave army rangers and navy seals . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

her state of west virginia is relieved . |||O O O O O O O O 
i spoke with jessica lynch 's father last evening and shared with him our thoughts and good wishes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we 'll have more on the march toward baghdad after a quick break . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O

push to baghdad begins ; pow safe in army 's care |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
woodruff u.s. forces moving ever closer to baghdad , but military officials say they are not counting on capitulation . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for a look at what might lie ahead for u.s. forces , let 's turn to our miles o'brien in atlanta . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thank you very much , judy . |||O O O O O O O 
to help guide us through all this discussion about red zones , and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the republican guard , we turn to colonel patrick lang . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's retired with the united states army . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
he spent some time in the defence intelligence agency , among other things . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
colonel , good to have you with us . |||O O O O O O O O O 
col . pat lang ( ret , ) , u.s. army you 're welcome . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is it the republican guard or is it the u.s. and coalition supply lines ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , they are close enough up to baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock , food , fuel and ammunition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these republican guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind , that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
once they are satisfied they are through all that , i would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into baghdad , probing hard to see how much resistance there really is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , let me ask you that . |||O O O O O O O O 
first of all , i just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is that karbala area which is about 50 miles from baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
baghdad is roughly in that direction from there . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of the next key points along the way here is saddam international airport . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you suppose that is a key target right now ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh , i 'm sure it is . |||O O O O O O O O 
i mean a feature of that importance would always be something you 'd want to hold . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and besides , as soon as you get control of it you 'd be able to start using it for air operations , and put a survey team in there as soon as it 's secured , and then start using it for helicopter operations , haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown baghdad , they 'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
o'brien now , as you go from saddam international airport into town you see there are some big , wide divided highways there . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
control of these highways will be crucial wo n't it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
lang yeah , these are the high - speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd mechanized infantry division just love high - speed approaches . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they will try to go down those things , cutting the city up into sectors as best they can , and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would think , probably , various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
it 's a big city , about the size of philadelphia or thereabouts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some have said chicago is a good analogy . |||O O O O O O O O O 
tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source , or am a wrong ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , it depends on the attitude of the populous , which is not clear yet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the population , in fact , or at least a big part of them like the |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
shia half of the population , if they want to be liberated , then you can control them with a fairly small force . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if , in fact , a lot of people in the city do n't want to be liberated and you 're never going to know that until you try , then you 're going to need a much larger force , and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
based on what you 've seen so far , what is your sense of that ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the shias are a bit gun shy , if you will , in the south because of what happened in 1991 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
they rose up , did n't get american support . |||O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O 
do you suppose it will be a different story in baghdad ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is there a lot of latent hatred for saddam hussein that will come out ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yes , there is , but these folks are going to be mighty cautious . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have a long history of being kicked around by the sunni arab population of central iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they do n't have any particular reason to trust us , so far . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so they 'll wait and see what happens . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's the other people in the city you have to worry about , who are ethnically much the same as the saddam hussein regime . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and their behavior right now is unpredictable . |||O O O O O O O O 
o'brien colonel patrick lang , retired , united states army , thanks for your insights . |||O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
a man who has been to baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it 's going to be like to fight on those avenues in that sprawling city of baghdad - judy . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O

push to baghdad begins ; pow safe in army 's care |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
as coalition forces push ahead in their march toward baghdad , they have encountered some resistance in the shiite holy city of karbala . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but american troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and to the south , british forces continue their attack on targets around basra . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
itn correspondent tim ewart reports . |||O O O O O O 
these are soldiers of the u.s. 3rd infantry , fighting near karbala , southwest of baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
they are facing saddam hussein 's republican guard , his finest soldiers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but for all the resistance , coalition aircraft rule the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. commanders believe the republican guard is a doomed force . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
gen . vincent brooks , u.s. central command |||O O O O O O O O 
the dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime right now and will remain pointed at it until the regime is gone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to the south , more black smoke over the town of basra . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
british troops control the outskirts of the town , and today destroyed another building they said housed iraqi fighters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
there is much fear here of the saddam loyalists who still hold sway in basra and of the invading troops waiting at the gates . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the americans are racing towards baghdad , the british still seem anxious to make their progress here as measured as possible . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but there may first be fighting in the capital , 250 miles to the north . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
tim ewart , itv news , southern iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O 
from the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern iraq , coalition air strikes targeted iraqi positions today in what 's been called a ferocious bombardment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
it happened outside the oil - rich city of kirkuk . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
cnn 's brent sadler is there . |||O O O O O O O 
a back road leading to kirkuk , the heartland of northern iraq 's oil wealth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a road that 's now in the hands of iraqi kurdish forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
occupying these positions , strattled along a crescent - shaped front line east of kirkuk . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this land fell into iraqi- kurdish hands without a shot being fired . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry , under the onslaught of coalition bombing . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
this is the end of the road for kurdish forces manning this remote checkpoint . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but with special permission , they let us through . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we are now between the lines , a no man 's land of abandoned iraqi bunkers and an unnerving silence , broken by the roar of warplanes and the distant surge of air strikes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
this territory is within easy artillery range of saddam hussein 's forces and circling kirkuk . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the oil capital of northern iraq is visible behind me , just over there , a harmless flare of burning gases is easily identifiable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iraq 's precious oil field remain intact . |||O O O O O O O O 
also intact , kirkuk 's defenses , in the distant haze . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

push to baghdad begins ; pow safe in army 's care |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
woodruff with u.s. forces rolling closer and closer to baghdad , the military seems to be zeroing in on the ground war . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
but , as it has from the beginning , air power remains an important part of the battle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
let 's check in with cnn 's gary tuchman at an air base near iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gary you 've seen it firsthand from the first moments . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
in two weeks after the air war began , there is no let - up and no effective response from the iraqis . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
according to the air force , at any given time , there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over iraq , flying to iraq or flying from iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O 
we come to you from a base near the iraqi border . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
many pilots are flying these a - 10 attack planes behind me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are also marine fa - 18s and marine heriers at this base . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we can tell you that a lot of pilots of this base are not flying to another base in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
it 's a base that was taken over by the coalition last week . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O 
and we spent part of the day at that base . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and when you arrive there , you are greeted in a sense by saddam hussein . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the are no more iraqis here , the coalition took over this base last week . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O 
it 's now a major staging point . |||O O O O O O O O 
you know you are in iraq when you drive down the road coming into the base and see the portrait of saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what 's happen is the military personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers and are writing messages on saddam hussein 's portrait . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can see the main one here on the bottom and also here messages like , we won , april 1 , 2003 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
want to give you a look . |||O O O O O O O 
there 's a lot of security personnel here . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you can look over there and you can see the military vehicles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these are air force security forces with their rifles patrolling the entrance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there is a lot of fighting in this area . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
we 're near the town of nasiriya . |||O O O O O O O O 
but this base now is considered secure enough to make it a major staging point for the coalition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a short time ago we talked to a pilot at this base who has been to that iraqi base and he too says he has signed that mural right on saddam hussein 's sash . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after he told us that , we asked him during his missions , and he 's flown about 30 in the last two weeks , we asked him does he still have any artillery being fired at him ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i was up just south of baghdad by 30 miles and we were fighting sa - 2s and sa - 6s and aaa on the ground . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so they 're still out there . |||O O O O O O O 
but the air power and the air package that we take to the fight , we continue to be effective . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we attrit the medina forces down to less than 50 percent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and when we put our power punch to them and then the army and the marines move forward it 's a very effective , coordinated effort . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tuchman lieutenant colonel webb ( ph ) is telling us he has a mission this very evening . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we want to tell you the air force has just informed us that between this morning and tomorrow morning , it will fly 1,900 sorties into iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
a total over the last two weeks now of close to 24,000 sorties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
before we go , one more thing we want to tell you about , superstitions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
military people are very superstitious , like many of us are . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here at this particular base they get their mres , their mres are their meals ready to eat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they come in a bag . |||O O O O O O 
and when you get an mre you get your meal and you get a little treat with it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what a lot of people here at this base do , when their treat happens to be this one , this is the candy called charms , many of the people refuse to eat their charms . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they consider it a good luck charm to keep their charms in their clothes and not to eat them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so one little superstitious tale for you , judy . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i 'm one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to our superstitions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gary , one another quick question for you . |||O O O O O O O O O 
that air base that coalition forces have now taken control of near nasiriya . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
are you able to say , are they actually using it or getting much use out of it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what they are doing , judy , some of these a - 10s behind me go there to refuel , to stage operations further north . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
they also fly these hh - 60 helicopters , they 're the search and rescue helicopters used in case they have to search and find somebody on the ground . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they stage there and refuel . |||O O O O O O 
but right now , none of them are permanently based there , although the plan is for that to eventually happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all right , gary tuchman with some charms . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you saw him holding it . |||O O O O O O 
i will be talking with a ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee , senator joe biden , just ahead , for his take on how the war is going . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O

iraqis mistakenly believe soldiers have sights on sacred landmark |||O O O O O O O O O 
with the power out now in baghdad , we 're getting word that loudspeakers have been blaring in the iraqi capital , urging citizens to go to the international airport there , presumably to defend it against coalition forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now that armored columns of u.s. - led troops have reached the outskirts of baghdad , eyewitnesses report fighting and shelling around saddam hussein international airport . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O 
in the final push to baghdad , u.s. forces face limited resistance from iraqi troops . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the pentagon believes some iraqi republican guard units have withdrawn to the capital for what could be their last stand . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
farther south in basra , smoke rose over the city as coalition vehicles moved in today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O 
british forces say they 're consolidating their position in basra 's key suburbs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and in northern iraq , kurdish political leaders and members of the iraqi opposition are engaged in talks with u.s. military commanders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
they reportedly are exploring the option of joining forces against saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coalition forces launched their latest advances toward baghdad in the pre-dawn hours today , heading toward the iraqi capital from the southeast and the southwest . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the forces encountered limited resistance along the way and are now poised for the final assault not far from the edge of the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O

baghdad is now within striking distance as troops make their final thrust through the desert . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
wrecked armor by the sides of the road suggests there has been some iraqi opposition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but by and large , the republican guard has either been destroyed or has withdrawn . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
and the way seems to be open for coalition forces to close in on the city 's southern limits . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
at daybreak , u.s. troops pushed through the outskirts of karbala on the road to baghdad , capturing a key bridge on the euphrates river . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
meanwhile , coalition commanders posted american special forces were now operating at will . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these dramatic pictures show a raid on a presidential palace less than 60 miles from baghdad . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
it seems to have been abandoned , but the united states said it was still on the trail of saddam and his closest circle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
vincent brooks , u.s. central command |||O O O O O O 
we do n't think that the fighting is over yet , and so there are still options available to the regime , including the use of weapons of mass destruction . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
we take that very seriously . |||O O O O O O 
we take it in a sober fashion . |||O O O O O O O O 
and at the same time , we remain prepared to continue operations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the americans say they 've destroyed two divisions of the elite republican guard . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
the medina division , which is one of the toughest outfits in the republican guard is now down to 10 percent of its fighting strength . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
that means it 's practically inoperative . |||O O O O O O O 
others are down to 50 percent , but there 's still one or two divisions around 75 , 80 , 90 percent of their fighting strength , and they could still put up very stiff resistance , indeed , when the american forces get en masse to baghdad itself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the noose appears to be tightening on saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O

wolf , we 're going to break in here , because the parents of jessica lynch , who live in palestine , west virginia , are before the microphones , i 'm told , just about to talk with reporters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're walking toward the press . |||O O O O O O O 
greg lynch sr. , jessica lynch 's father |||O O O O O O O O 
we appreciate y'all coming out for what you 're doing for jessie and all of the other troops that are missing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've been waiting all day word from the doctors , and they have successively done one surgery on her . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there will be other surgeries to do that . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's going to take time and patience . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but she 's great and she 's doing good . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
g. lynch she 's in real good spirits . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we talked to her before the surgery , we talked to her after the surgery , and she 's doing good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yes , a bunch , but my mind 's blank . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the doctor has completed one surgery on her back . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they have released the pressure on a nerve , and realigned all the disks and put plates and stuff in it , and that was because she did n't have any feeling in her feet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so he , he 's pretty sure right now that that will relieve , relieve the tension , and her feet will be able to move . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also , we have heard and seen reports that she had multiple gunshot wounds , and knife stabbing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O B-TRI I-TRI 
the doctor has not seen any of this . |||O O O O O O O O O 
he looked for the gunshot wounds for the knife stabbing , and there is no injury whatsoever . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O 
they will do surgery again tomorrow on her legs . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
she has fractured legs and her right forearm . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
and we are just waiting to get that good news too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we talked to her before and after the surgery , like i said , and she 's just , she just sounded real good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course , this morning she was a little groggy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but yet , she was good , because it was early . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then this afternoon , after the surgery , she was our jessie again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if those were n't gunshot wounds to cause the broken bones , do they know what caused the fractures ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
they have no idea at this time what caused them . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
we know she 's in good spirits , because they told her they was gon na put pink casts on her legs and arms , and she had pink casts when she was in the third grade on her arm so we know she -- her mind is working good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so she 's in good spirits , and we hope the surgery will go good tomorrow , just as well as it did today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
can you tell us what she said to you on the telephone ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
you said she was in good spirits ? |||O O O O O O O O 
can you describe your conversation ? |||O O O O O O 
g. lynch i teased her again about the army jeeps and she said , " i know where there 's a bunch of that we can find . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , we know she 's in good spirits . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
she was asking for a hairbrush . |||O O O O O O O 
woodruff gregory lynch , the father of jessica lynch , and jessica 's mother talking to reporters , saying they have talked to her today , both before and after surgery , that she says she 's feeling good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they say she will be good . |||O O O O O O O 
but they said the doctors did go in and apparently do some work on her spinal cord or spinal column . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said to relieve some pressure on a nerve . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they were concerned because she did n't have feeling in her feet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they did go on to say the doctors could not find either bullet or knife entry wounds , suggesting that her broken bones came from some other source , and it is not clear yet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
her parents said they do n't know yet what caused their daughter 's injuries . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
iraqis mistakenly believe soldiers have sights on sacred landmark |||O O O O O O O O O 
back now to the battlefront and to the southern city of najaf , home to one of islam 's holiest sites , moments of tension that could have gone either way today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a tip leads the bastogne brigade 's no slack batallion to this parking lot in najaf where the fedayeen are said to have stashed weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the search turns up nothing . |||O O O O O O 
the only resistance comes from a volvo . |||O O O O O O O O 
the shia population seems curious and friendly but they do n't get too close . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this man agrees to be interviewed as long as his face is n't shown . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the iraqi government , he says , has satellite tv . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
anybody could be an informer and punish us for talking to you , even my family , he tells me in arabic . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the troops also keep their distance . |||O O O O O O O 
yes , it 's very uneasy out here . |||O O O O O O O O O 
chilcote sergeant rod sutton from indiana on the corner of a street leading to the highly sensitive imam ali shrine , one of the holiest sites in the world for shia muslims . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
does it make you nervous that you 're so close to the ali mosque ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you feel like you 're tramping on . |||O O O O O O O O O 
sgt. rod sutton , bastogne brigade |||O O O O O O 
to some extent , i feel fortunate that i 'm here , because this is something i never would have seen before . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now that i see it i kind of understand some of the history behind it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , it makes me more appreciative of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
to the same extent , i do n't want to be invasive with these people here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't want to trample on their holy ground , and i want to respect that as much as i can . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
word comes from the grand ayatollah sistani that he 's willing to meet the american commander , but he asks first for soldiers to secure his compound , located halfway down the road to the mosque . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no one explains that to the crowd . |||O O O O O O O O 
there is no more striking example of the sensitivities that the u.s. soldiers face here than what is taking place on the streets right up from the ah ali mosque right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
chaos as the crowd apparently believes the soldiers want to approach the shrine . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
they want to get inside the holy shrine of imam ali . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
chilcote clerics appear with a message from the grand ayatollah , but the message is did drowned out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the colonel instructs his men to stay calm . |||O O O O O O O O O 
they got to understand , he wants us here . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
his soldiers take a knee , their weapons brought down from the ready position . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they do everything soldiers can to appear less hostile . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
but the potential for confrontation remains . |||O O O O O O O 
the commander makes the decision . |||O O O O O O 
turn around , just turn around and go . |||O O O O O O O O O 
he orders his men back to their compound to await cooler heads . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
ryan chilcote , cnn with the 101st airborne in najaf , iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
woodruff and cnn 's nic robertson telling us earlier , significant that the shia muslim ayatollahs , what they did , that they were cooperating with coalition and u.s. troops , saying that that will send an important signal to shia muslims throughout the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , u.s. officials are investigating two possible friendly fire incidents in which coalition forces may have mistakenly shot at allied aircraft . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
in one of the incidents , a soldier was killed and several others wounded . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
before word of that death , 40 americans had been killed by hostile fire in operation iraqi freedom . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O 
eleven of them by friendly fire or in other accidents . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
most of the 27 british troops killed have been victims of friendly fire or accidents . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
meantime , iraq says that 420 civilians , they say , have been killed during the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
and they say 4,000 injured . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
u.s. officials say more than 4,000 iraqis have been captured . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
seven americans we know remain prisoners of war in iraq . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
fifteen others are said to be still missing in action . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , when they do finally enter baghdad , u.s. and coalition troops could face urban combat with the republican guard , some of whom may have withdrawn into the city . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
but the u.s. military is expecting to remain focused on specific targets in the iraqi capital . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nevertheless , cnn 's miles o'brien is with our military analyst , lieutenant colonel robert leonard , he is a persian gulf war veteran and a military science professor at west virginia university -- miles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iraqis mistakenly believe soldiers have sights on sacred landmark |||O O O O O O O O O 
and colonel leonhard , we 're going to talk a little bit about urban combat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
and i wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat , they think of that blackhawk down scenario , mogadishu and the problems that can go wrong here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is not probably a comparable situation , is it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
robert leonhard , u.s. army ( ret . ) |||O O O O O O O O O 
and one of the reasons is because we have armored fighting vehicles there in baghdad , and we will use them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those tanks have 120 - millimeter smoothbore gun on them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the bradleys have 25 - millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's a lot of mobile protective gunfire . |||O O O O O O O O O 
completely different from the mogadishu situation in which we did not have such vehicles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we also are not going to use similar tactics there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are much more likely to use patience and finesse rather than assault tactics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
we want to show you an animation , and share with our viewers , maybe you can point out a few things about this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if we move in on baghdad , and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
what we 've depicted here is something here which shows some armor sort of off the wings here , right over here is a mosque . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we depict that to show that 's something you obviously want to stay clear as we just saw with the ryan chilcote piece from najaf . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as we get a little bit closer here , in a typical scenario like this , you might very well have republican guard snipers up on balconies like this , and possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti-aircraft artillery or artillery encampments like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what we have presented her is an armored column with air support coming in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how much jeopardy is a column like this in as it goes through these concrete canyons in a city ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment , and that is why movement through an urban area is very , very dangerous . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's the side that 's moving that 's going to take the casualties . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
that said , the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they 're moving a little bit faster as than we probably will . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll use patience and finesse . |||O O O O O O O 
we will take the time to locate the enemy , surround the blocks and the buildings that he is in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then we 'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable , to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O 
at which time we can engage them or arrest them . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O 
we 'd like to resume with that animation if we could . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
can we get back to the animation . |||O O O O O O O O 
and i 'd like to just finish this out . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
ad we move it along , you 'll see eventually the troops will come marching in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in this case , slightly off target here because you see them all going in the front door . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
typically , when they 'd assault a target like this , they 'd do what ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
well , typically , if they do go in , which is generally the option of last resort , but if we do have to go in , often we 'll try to go in from the top of the building down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot in clearing buildings , and grenades ten to offend downhill rather than uphill . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , you always want them going down staircases rather than having to try to throw them up the staircase . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gravity rules , even in urban combat . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
lieutenant colonel robert leonard , we appreciate your insights in urban combat , something that is not something that the u.s. military would prefer to engage in , but it might become inevitable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it was a showpiece of his regime . |||O O O O O O O O 
now saddam international airport is controlled by coalition troops and , tonight , it has a new name , baghdad international . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

building by building , they swept the terminal complex , then moved on to secure the runway . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fall of his airport is a humiliating blow for saddam . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it lies just 12 miles from baghdad and will be a key forward base for u.s. troops as they prepare for a push on the capital . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
more than 300 iraqi soldiers have been left dead . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
some republican guard troops fought fiercely on the northern side of the airport complex . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
hopefully , this is a sign that we 're able to send to the residents of baghdad that we 're here and they can rise up and deal with the regime appropriately . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
outside the airport , the fighting was fierce , but the battle unequal . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O 
here , the remains of an iraqi armored car , and by its side the body of an iraqi soldier , all that remains of a column that pushed up the airport road last night in a final effort to defend the airport . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. troops are now knocking on the door of baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the final push into the city could yet prove to be the toughest fighting of all . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
the patchy , somewhat disorganized defense of the airport last night has left coalition commanders with several questions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
have they done so much damage now to iraqi command and control centers that they can no longer put up a proper fight , or are the best troops simply withdrawing into the city , to fight there street by street ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
the answer to that could well decide how quickly they make a final push into the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O

after a day of fighting , the iraqis were driven back five kilometers , about three miles down the main road west towards mosul from the kurdish city of erbil . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

at last report , though , 41 americans had been killed by hostile forces , 13 others by friendly fire or in accidents . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
of the 27 british troops , in all who have been killed , at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendly fire or accidents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
the official iraqi casualty figures remain the same this day , including more than 400 civilians killed , iraqi authorities say . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
and u.s. central command says more than 4,000 iraqis have been captured , but british officials believe that figure is much higher . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we know that seven americans are known to be held as prisoner of war in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

he received word of his son 's death within hours after the submarine that he was assigned to returned home from an extended deployment . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the iraqis promise an unconventional attack on u.s. troops tonight . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
do they mean guerilla warfare , as in vietnam ? |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
we 're going to ask our military analyst . |||O O O O O O O O O 
coalition troops penetrate outskirts of baghdad |||O O O O O O 
and we will see you then . |||O O O O O O O 
well , as coalition forces push ahead in their bid to capture baghdad , big questions remain about saddam hussein and his whereabouts . |||O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is still not clear , looking at the latest tapes of the iraqi president , whether he 's dead or alive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
cnn senior international correspondent nic robertson , who was expelled from baghdad , is with us now from the border of iraq and jordan , on the jordanian side , to talk about what 's happening in the iraqi capital . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nic , we 're getting information in bits and pieces about the incursion by coalition land forces , about air flights over the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
help us pull it all together . |||O O O O O O O 
nic robertson , cnn senior international correspondent |||O O O O O O O 
well , from what we hear from sources in baghdad this evening , it had been mostly quiet in terms of bombing throughout the day in baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
then there was a large explosion not far from the hotel journalists are staying in in the center of baghdad . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
along the riverfro nt there , there are a number of ba'ath party houses and buildings that appear to be -- have some sort of military function . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's not clear exactly what the target was . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
what we 're hearing from iraqi people in the capital today is that they know and they have seen coalition forces in the southwest of the city , in the southeast of the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they say they have also seen coalition forces and believe coalition forces have a checkpoint on the northern outskirts of baghdad as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so as far as the iraqi people are concerned , they are very aware that coalition forces are right on the perimeter of the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our sources are also telling us that iraqi forces are massing artillery pieces and tanks at a number of locations on the southwestern edge of the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these locations , actually , very close to the center of baghdad and appear to be forming something sort of front line against the coalition forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , iraq 's minister of information today said that the coalition did not have control of the airport , that this was some sort of contrived video from the first day , and that , in fact , hundreds of coalition soldiers had been killed , and their graves were now at the airport . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
he did promise to take journalists to the airport , however , he never made -- he did n't make good on that promise throughout the day . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the information minister also read a statement from president saddam hussein today , the iraqi leader calling on people to be resolute , to be strong , and saying that if they put up a good fight , then the coalition would eventually back down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O

robertson now , representatives of the committee -- the international committee for the red cross , who have been to some of the hospitals in baghdad , report higher - than - usual numbers of casualties coming into those hospitals . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
roland nuguenin - benjamin , international committee of the red cross ( on phone ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we had a chance in the morning to go to the main hospital , which is called yarmuk ( ph ) , and we found there has been a steady flow in of hundreds of casualties , all over the night and through into the day , casualties -- i mean , war wounded had to be sent over , dispatched to other hospitals , because this yarmuk was just totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of people coming in . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI 
now , these red cross representatives say that most -- that two - thirds of the casualties they 've seen in this particular hospital are , in fact , military casualties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and iraqi officials promise to take journalists to this particular hospital , the yarmuk hospital , that is now located , it 's on the southwest of baghdad , and it appears to be pretty much between the position of where coalition forces have been seen and where iraq now has a militarized front - line position . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , when journalists were taken to see that hospital , twice they were turned around and told that they were n't actually allowed to go inside that hospital , judy . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O 
woodruff nic , when you say iraqis are seen now putting artillery pieces out and around the city , are you saying out in the open , where they can -- where they are vulnerable , or are they making any attempt to hide them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
give us clearer picture of that . |||O O O O O O O 
one of the areas where i understand they 're locating tanks and artillery pieces is the zawara ( ph ) park . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is fairly central in baghdad on the edge of a government area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is a garden -- it is a large garden - type area for people to take their children to go and play . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
it 's -- there 's a small zoo there as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is , if you will , on the -- facing towards the southwestern area of the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it faces off against the highway that leads out to the airport . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , that is not in a residential area . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it is a clear , open area , apart from trees . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the other areas that we understand where iraqi officials are placing tanks and blocking off streets are in more residential areas , judy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nic robertson , giving us a better understanding of exactly what the iraqis are doing to prepare for any further moves by coalition forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nic , thank you very much . |||O O O O O O O

saddam hussein and his henchmen still claim to control this southern port . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

soldiers are here to tear down the regime and all it stands for . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
by the time they leave iraq , they 're determined saddam and his ba'ath party will have bitten the dust . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI I-TRI 
the approach can seem frustratingly slow , but day by day , the desert rats are exerting more control . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
checkpoints meant to filter out iraqi hardliners . |||O O O O O O O O 
they 're well within striking distance of the mortars and rockets of the fedayeen militia , but they 're prepared to take that risk to try and persuade the people of basra that they wo n't desert them , that they 'll stick with this however messy it gets . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
drastic action is need to convince a dubious population . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we watched a nighttime raid on the homes of ba'ath party officials and fedayeen militia . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
these are men singled out by locals and believed by army intelligence to be behind much of the brutality and corruption . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most are not accused of specific crimes but suspected of being part of the state - sponsored climate of fear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

some are clearly terrified of what lies ahead , uncertain of their fate , overcome by nerves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but as it ended , there was no british apology for the scale of the operation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we came in firm , we came in fair . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
there was no shots fired . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
we gave a good warning before we came in . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've been playing warnings to people to stay in their houses , and we 've only lifted those people we 've got very good intelligence on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
this is not a tactic that can be regularly repeated , or the british risk being accused of installing their own rule of terror . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
despite the discomfort of a few , there 's a conviction that this is a night 's work that will benefit the majority . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you know , just those two words together , i think , scare a lot of people because of all the things that can go wrong . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , i 'm impressed , looking at this map , it almost looks like a chess game , kind of sterile . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is -- could n't be further from the truth , could it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
j. kelly mccann , cnn security analyst |||O O O O O O O 
this is very clean and it 's very orderly . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
suddenly when we show the videotape and we start to go there , you 'll see just how conflicted an environment that is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and all happening so quickly . |||O O O O O O 
we 're going to kind of play it and stop it , and kelly 's going to walk us through , i guess , urban combat 101 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
what are we seeing here ? |||O O O O O O 
mccann just there , i mean , just getting the door out of the way , you can see where the weapons have to go . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , you just see this soldier right here , he 's going to his sidearm to make a little bit more mobile . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and he 's got to be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , he 's going to go that direction , because that room is clear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
go ahead and stop the tape.as you make every entry , miles , there are two dead spots , one , of course , in this direction right here , which you ca n't see from the doorway , the other in this direction right here , and that 's always the problem , because as you come in here , you 've got to be able to get in there quickly and make sure that this person here does n't get shot in the back . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
now , what about this , this armor ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
tell us how they 're equipped with armor there . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
mccann level 4 armor , this is not just for frag . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this will also stop bullets . |||O O O O O O 
the normal flak jacket will stop fragments from grenades , et cetera . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a plate that will actually stop and deform a bullet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let 's roll tape and continue on here and talk about -- now , i notice his hand -- his sidearm is attached to him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mccann ... ( unintelligible ) retention , for retention capability . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
so he goes down the hallway , and you can see once that 's called clear , straight trigger finger , in case there 's any sympathetic muscle tightening , there 's no problem . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 'll see another person come right up here , and he 'll hold on this door , because that 's not been cleared space yet , again , straight trigger finger , but ready to shoot if he needs to . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
sort of ready but not quite ( unintelligible ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
mccann immediately making entry with the thing , and then pying ( ph ) the room out , getting angles of vision as they clear it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but look at that , a dark space from a lighted space . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
who knows what 's in the recesses ? |||O O O O O O O O 
let 's roll that second tape quickly , and we 'll show you a couple more tips from kelly 's perspective . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so far , what we 're seeing is pretty much textbook . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , this is a rural setting , but this could be applied to urban combat , yes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O 
same thing when you come into a building . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
but stop the tape right here ... |||O O O O O O O 
oop , we missed it , we missed it ... |||O O O O O O O O O O 
mccann ... if you would , ( unintelligible ) -- |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you can see all this area ... |||O O O O O O O 
o'brien no , just roll it . |||O O O O O O O 
just go ahead and roll it . |||O O O O O O O 
all of that has to be accounted for as well , not just the space in here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
your back is not covered . |||O O O O O O 
many angles you 've got to watch for . |||O O O O O O O O O 
now , you see right here , he 's got a sidearm , he 's calling the team in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all the rear is -- now , stop the tape . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
mccann imagine a person that is concealed anywhere in here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , you could have anyone with a rifle back in these areas here ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
up in this area here , here ... |||O O O O O O O O 
mccann ... in any of these recesses back over here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , you know , you 're looking at -- he would n't have a bomb ( unintelligible ) ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , he would n't have that . |||O O O O O O O O 
but let me ask you this . |||O O O O O O O 
also that the garb , ( unintelligible ) there 's a cultural issue here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that provides a lot of cover for weapons if need be , right ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and someones might say , well , why put their hands on their head like this ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because , you know , you -- the hands hurt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i wo n't be able to determine what you 're doing with your face . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
where are your hands and what do they hold ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
let 's roll it real quickly and we 'll make a few more points , if we could . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a lot of fear in their faces here . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you see , by the way , they all have radios , i notice they have , like , a little headset there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that allows them to communicate ( unintelligible ) ... |||O O O O O O O O O 
you see them having their sectors of fire . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
all these areas up in here , you know , could be subjected to people hiding , et cetera . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now you 've got people coming down that have already been cleared . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
look at the fear on the faces . |||O O O O O O O O 
they do n't understand what 's going on . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and you want to keep them calm , and ... |||O O O O O O O O O O 
very calm , reassure them that this is n't about them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mccann now , here 's a little bit more aggressive stance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
go ahead and stop tape ... |||O O O O O O 
oh , we missed it again . |||O O O O O O O 
mccann ... if you can . |||O O O O O O 
obviously , that person is doing something that that soldier did n't appreciate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would say aggressive is a good word for that ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
o'brien ... the business end of that m - 16 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
all right , kelly mccann , thank you for some insights . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that -- compound that by a city of 5 million , it kind of boggles the mind and really gives you a sense of what lies head for u.s. and coalition forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thanks very much for your insights . |||O O O O O O O 
i 've always wondered what happened -- who covers the last man or woman in one of those operations , but that 's something for your next conversation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coalition troops penetrate outskirts of baghdad |||O O O O O O 
an investigation is under way at a makeshift morgue in southern iraq after a gruesome discovery by some british troops . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tim ewart of itn news reports on evidence of atrocities at an abandoned iraqi military base . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tim ewart , itv news ( voice - over ) |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the remains of hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and unsealed hard - board coffins . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
british troops found the bodies at an abandoned iraqi military base on the outskirts of azubayr . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the evidence suggested it was the scene of appalling atrocities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the teeth in many of the skulls had been broken , and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's not clear how long the bodies had lain here , but they were clearly not from this war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
you come to expect everything in war fighting . |||O O O O O O B-TRI B-TRI I-TRI 
it was a bit more of a surprise when i discovered the bags with the human remains inside . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
inside a neighboring building , there was evidence of cells and a catalog of photographs of the dead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most had died from gunshot wounds to the head . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
others were mutilated beyond recognition , their faces burned and swollen . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
outside , soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose - built shooting gallery , the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
forensic specialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth of what happened here and when . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( on camera ) : today 's discovery seems to provide shocking evidence of atrocities under saddam hussein 's regime . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most people are afraid to talk openly about what 's been happening here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but when they do , british soldiers believe , more horrors will come to light . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tim ewart , itv news , azubayr . |||O O O O O O O O 
well , from a gruesome finding to a dangerous one in central iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. troops work to clear that area of iraqi weapons , coming up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coalition troops penetrate outskirts of baghdad |||O O O O O O 
we 've been hearing about the situation in northern and southern iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now to central iraq , where coalition forces say they are now in charge . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they are coming across some major munitions finds . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the caches were apparently abandoned by retreating iraqi forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
one such cache turned up in the city of karbala , a strategic military point about 60 miles to the south of baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
cnn 's ryan chilcote is embedded with the 101st airborne division , and he has the story . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
can you show us what you 've been finding today ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
sgt. 1 st class larry clark , u.s. army roger . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , this is about the third cache we 've found today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've been finding them nonstop , and it 's a really tedious affair . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've got an assortment of weapons right here , ranging from ak - 47s , to over here , behind them , you 'll see mortar sights , 60 - millimeter and 81 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
off on the far left , you 'll see a second - generation starscope , kind of outdated , but still works . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you keep shifting over , you 'll see stabilizer fins for mortar rounds . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the back here , you 'll see both 60 - and 82 - millimeter mortars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , they 're very well equipped . |||O O O O O O O O 
definitely put up a fight . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
been finding a lot of these lately . |||O O O O O O O O 
these could take out a jeep or a humvee in a heartbeat . |||O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
chilcote now , is this a -- you said you 'd seen a lot of weapons caches recently found . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is this a large cache ? |||O O O O O O 
no , i 'd say this is about a medium cache . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this looks like a lot of weapons . |||O O O O O O O O 
it looks like a lot of weapons , but it 's really not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this -- technically , this would probably would outfit a platoon , a platoon of ( unintelligible ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a little bit more advanced , these are 25 -millimeter shells , and each one of those silver boxes you see behind them hold 50 of these shells . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's a little bit above us . |||O O O O O O O O 
that 's actually going into mechanized and armor . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and you were talking about the makers , where some of these weapons are coming from , and you were expressing surprise to me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a majority of these are coming from -- ( unintelligible ) on this box , but jordan and france . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have a very scattered , limited , and russian equipment , but like i said , france and jordan are the main suppliers right here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now for your guys , this is dangerous work , finding ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's -- yes , it 's extremely dangerous , because once you enter these buildings , we found , actually , enemy , you know , guarding these sites . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do n't know if they 're going to be booby trapped . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do n't know what -- what 's going to be there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it 's very tedious , it 's -- got to be careful about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , we 've heard a whole lot about iraq 's use of human shields in defending key sites . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coalition fighters , though , use a different kind of shield . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in a cnn exclusive , cnn 's kyra phillips offers us a ride - along over the city of baghdad with some airborne bodyguards . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we wo n't consider the mission a success unless the marines are happy with the product . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kyra phillips , cnn correspondent ( voice - over ) |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they are coalition bodyguards over baghdad , an airborne shield to u.s. marines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let them know what 's coming . |||O O O O O O O 
let them know if anything is coming back behind them on their franks to close off the supply lines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 're now airborne over iraq with commander steve kroto 's ( ph ) gray knights , the navy's p - 3 eyes in the sky . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
any kind of forces that look like they may be threatening the marines , you know , we want to let them know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we have the capability to send pictures or actual video , and then they can make ( unintelligible ) if they want to maybe avoid that area or go ahead and go out and engage those folks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
phillips dodging missiles and triple - a fire is something new to this squadron . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
however , protecting forces on the ground is n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
these men are about three hours into their mission , and the sun is starting to set . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 've just come across one of the marine convoys that they need to track , so they 're watching every move that the marines make as they move towards baghdad , making sure they do n't come across any type of threat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're getting closer to it . |||O O O O O O O 
also on this mission , marine colonel jim lukeman ( ph ) and sergeant emilio hernandez . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are tracking and talking to their fellow marines on the ground ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
two vehicles move across the bridge ... |||O O O O O O O 
phillips ... making sure they do n't get ambushed . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
i 'm looking for enemy positions out to the front . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll look at the routes ahead of where our guys are going to go and try to see what enemy is there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
phillips lukeman is warning his troops about a bridge ahead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
he does n't like what he sees . |||O O O O O O O O 
the gray knights fly closer and grab a clearer picture . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's some vehicular traffic , so that we know the bridge is still intact . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they may be iraqi military . |||O O O O O O 
so now that the marine division on the ground has that information , they 'll take that action -- they 'll take action tactically on it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these flights can last up to 15 hours , but it 's the minutes of realtime intelligence that completes the mission . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when you 're on the ground fighting , every piece of information you 've got about what you 're coming up against is golden . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
steve kroto brings his crew home after locating enemy positions and surface - to - surface missiles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it keeps the marines safe . |||O O O O O O

julian manyon , itn correspondent ( voice - over ) |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it is another friendly fire disaster . |||O O O O B-TRI O O 
this morning , an american bomb destroyed a convoy carrying high officials of the kurdish peshmerga forces , which have been fighting alongside the americans on the northern front . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
at least 17 kurdish commanders and their guards were killed , along with an interpreter working for the bbc . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
more than 40 were injured . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
the military chief of the kurdish kdp , the brother of their leader , massud barzani ( ph ) , was gravely hurt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
trying to organize a northern front with just a few hundred u.s. special forces troops and the poorly armed kurdish peshmerga guerrillas was always going to be a high - risk exercise . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the idea was to open the way with heavy sustained american bombing of iraqi positions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
but today , it all went disastrously wrong . |||O O O O O O O O O 
even as we filmed the wreckage , u.s. jets were still dropping their bombs nearby . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
giant explosions erupted down the road . |||O B-TRI O O O O O 
earlier , we had joined another convoy of u.s. special forces troops and kurdish fighters as they tried to move south through country abandoned by the iraqi army . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at first , all was calm . |||O O O O O O O 
american troops controlled the operation from a rooftop . |||O O O O O O O O O 
then , as the kurds advanced again , the iraqis opened up . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI 
now we 're hearing the boom of iraqi guns as they fire towards our positions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
all morning , the kurds have been trying to advance , and that was the shell going off . ( voice - over ) : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O 
the iraqi gunners rapidly found our range , and we took refuge in an abandoned farm house . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we finally managed to get out by car . |||O O O O O O O O O

you just heard john reporting about it . |||O O O O O O O O 
they primarily talked about the war in iraq , the aftermath of iraq . |||O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI

it has been said that saddam hussein ruled iraq with an iron fist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i guess you can say in the past tense . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
his regime has left behind some disturbing evidence to support those claims . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the abandoned secret police headquarters in basra is just one example . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
itn 's bill neely is with the royal marines and he takes us on a tour of basra 's chamber of horrors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bill neely , itn reporter ( voice - over ) |||O O O O O O O O O O 
saddam hussein 's iraq is a state of terror , and this is where it 's planned and perpetrated , the headquarters of his secret police , this one in basra . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no british soldier has been here yet . |||O O O O O O O O 
today , as i walked in , i met iraqis , none of whom had ever been inside willingly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what was to follow was a horrific education in terror and torture : in the smoking basement of the bombed building , a warren of cells . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
people died , people in prison without court , without trial . |||O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
any people who saddam did not like . |||O O O O O O O O 
down we went , further to cells that had no light , little air , cockroaches , filth , and , on the ground , a gas mask and bottles of chemicals . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can imagine this every day , every month . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
so many people come here , but we do n't know about them at all . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these ordinary iraqis had been terrified to come here , until today , though one student on the left had been here before . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was one of the prisoners here . |||O O O O O O O O 
and his crime for eight years in jail ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
he prayed too much and was seen as a dangerous radical . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the mukhabarat headquarters had more horrors to reveal . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and they tied their hands behind and hung them and hung them for many days . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these men had relatives murdered here . |||O O O O B-TRI O O 
so desperate are they to tell their story that they began reenacting what they and their brothers and friends have suffered . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the hook in the ceiling is for one purpose only , another hook in a different cell and a different form of torture . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
saddam hussein controlled iraq through fear , torture and execution . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI I-TRI 
and it happened here to tens of thousands of iraqis that saddam 's secret police deemed dangerous . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this man cowered for months , crammed with 300 mothers into a huge cell . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hamid fatil ( ph ) may look like he 's acting , but he was tortured here , along with his two brothers , who were executed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
this man was here , too , with his brother . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they sentenced him to death . |||O B-TRI O O O O 
and they sent him to baghdad and killed . |||O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
he was hanged there , hanged . |||O O B-TRI O O B-TRI I-TRI 
there 's a prisoner under the name of ahmed adis aeid ( ph ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they kept records of prisoners , these and their fingerprints all that 's left of them , apart from the photographs they took of exactly what they had done . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if there is an evil center to saddam hussein 's regime , then it is surely here and in other places of torture . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and there 's plenty here that we simply can not show you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in this block , it was men over here , hundreds of them , and women and children here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to call all this a chamber of horrors is a cliche . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and this place is beyond cliche . |||O O O O O O O 
the hundreds or thousands who died here who were given no trial , no voice , cry out . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O 
on the ground , i found a book called " the psychology of interrogation , " as if the men who worked here for saddam needed a handbook . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was glad of the fresh air and glad to leave , glad i could . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no one knows yet whether the new iraq will be the kind of place where these children can grow up free of the fear , the horror of torture . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI

the casualty count helps put the ongoing debate about journalistic neutrality into a sharper light . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the 600 journalists embedded with american troops in iraq will be threatened by the same fire as the troops they are covering . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
their safety , their lives , may depend on those troops . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that raises a bigger question . |||O O O O O O O 
are they supposed to be neutral on the outcome of the war ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
in an interview with broadcasting and cable magazine , cbs news president andrew heyward said of the neutrality notion -- quote -- " it 's one of the stupidest things i 've ever heard . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this story is going to be told from a u.s. point of view . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are american reporters , the ones with the troops . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , none of this means journalists will ignore unsettling news : military setbacks , lack of supplies , the infliction of civilian casualties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
reporters who ignore or distort facts are betraying their craft no matter what and no matter how much that may anger the people running a war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
but whether in the old soviet union or nazi germany or south africa or iraq , respect for the facts does not require a reporter to throw his values over the side . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this man took the horse from a stable at the home of uday hussein , saddam 's eldest son . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this indeed was one of uday 's homes . |||O O O O O O O O O

saddam hussein is losing grip on northern cities in iraq |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well , laith kubba is an iraqi exile who has family members in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mr. kubba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the national endowment for democracy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he is also the president of a group of iraqi exiles , a group called the iraq national group . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he joins us now from london to talk about rebuilding his country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mr. kubba , first of all , your thoughts as you 've watched these scenes of baghdad , the saddam hussein regime falling in the last day ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
laith kubba , president , iraqi national group |||O O O O O O O O 
it is a huge sigh of relief , because it could have been much worse and baghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
and , obviously , there are four million people who could have suffered more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , obviously , there is a great , great concern about the scenes that you 've been showing on television . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are you talking to family members now in baghdad and around iraq ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , if you are , how concerned are they about the lawlessness ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kubba well , not in the recent three or four days . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are no phone lines to baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O 
in other parts of iraq , i received with great sadness the killing of one close colleague , saeed abu naji abhuey ( ph ) in najaf . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was not killed by former members of the baath party or the security of the army , but by just a local organized group . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so those signs to me are worrying . |||O O O O O O O O 
people are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the power vacuum and are testing it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and the more they test , the more i think they are claiming . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in iraq after this transition period , however long it is , where the u.s. is in charge ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , one needs to break down this process into various elements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
today , there should be an authority . |||O O O O O O O O 
and it 's very likely that the u.s. and the british forces are the authority on land . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and there ought to be administration . |||O O O O O O O 
and this ought to be primarily by iraqis . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but when it comes to government , i think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we need to involve the u.n . we need to involve all iraqi forces in the country , outside the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but we need to do it quickly , because every day passes by with this vacuum , it 's going to spell trouble . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , we know , mr. kubba , there are several iraqi exiles groups competing for influence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is one of them going to have an advantage ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and , particularly , i have in mind the iraqi national congress that mr. chalabi , who was assisted by u.s. forces in getting back into iraq ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i think it 's one thing to gain fame and access to washington . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in washington . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it must really be drawn on the ground inside iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and there are 22 million people there . |||O O O O O O O O 
and i think all plans must be anchored there in iraq in its reality . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so does one group have an advantage over another now ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are different groups who have advantage over others in different parts of the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
unfortunately , we do not have a national group that can appeal to iraqis as iraqis within a credible voice.this needs to be constructed , maybe through a conference to be held in baghdad , where representatives from provinces all over iraq need to participate , as well as political groups . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but we do not have a single group , a single leadership or a single council yet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're talking with laith kubba , who is the president of a group of iraqi exiles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the group is called the iraq national group . |||O O O O O O O O O 
mr. kubba , we thank you so much for talking to us from london . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here in washington , members of the house of representatives come together to support america 's armed forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

well , after many trying months of defending saddam hussein , ambassador mohammed aldouri finally said the game is over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , his tenure at the united nations is over , too . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O 
last night before leaving the united states , aldouri said he hopes to see free elections in a free iraq . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O

richard roth , cnn senior u.n. |||O O O O O O 
the last time iraqi 's u.n. ambassador addressed the security council , the u.s. ambassador walked out in protest . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mohammed aldouri , iraqi ambassador to u.n. ( through translator ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
what happened is that the iraqi army up until now has not confronted the united states forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but now , it 's the iraqi ambassador 's time to leave , the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
i hope that peace will prevail , and that the iraqi people at the end of the day will have a peaceful life . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roth mohammed aldouri spent more years as a university professor than as a diplomat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in new york , he briefed people interested in his country , recently a group of lehigh university students . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but he never got comfortable in the media glare before and especially during the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
aldouri ( unintelligible ) has happened with you ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
please , why did you come here ? |||O O O O O O O O 
aldouri tomorrow , i will see you in the u.n. |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and at the u.n. , all ambassadors carry out their instructions whether they agree with them or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
juan gabriel valdes , chilean ambassador to u.s. well , i think that he had a very , very difficult task . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he defended the positions of his country with courage , i would say . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jeremy greenstock , british ambassador to u.n. he 's a decent man , and i hope he finds a decent life representing a decent government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
unidentified male aldouri is a dear friend of mine . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
roth aldouri also drew support from opponents of the war a gift of paper cranes . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
but on the eve of aldouri 's departure , women representing the daughters of the american revolution passed by , wanting to let fly with something else . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if i had eggs , i would like to throw eggs at him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roth u.n. diplomats do n't toss eggs , just nods . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
several months ago , the u.s. ambassador , john negroponte , and the iraqi ambassador almost locked eyes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mohammed abulhasan , kuwaiti ambassador to u.n. nothing . |||O O O O O O O O O 
not one word , except a normal greeting of , " hello , how are you ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that was as close as residents of new york 's upper east side district got to know aldouri , who kept a low profile , like many in the big city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a neighborhood you would n't expect the diplomatic post of an enemy government to turn up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
aldouri i am very thankful for the people of new york , for their generosity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a very decent people . |||O O O O O O O 
i was really -- without talking about the problem in iraq , i was really happy to be here in new york , within the people of new york . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roth aldouri was worried most about the people of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
aldouri when i see , what i 've seen , what you see , my heart squeezes blood . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roth aldouri was in better spirits as he departed for the airport with a final message . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
aldouri i hope that the united states army will leave iraq soon , and we will have free election for a free government for a free future for iraq and the people for iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is my message to you , to the people of the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the ambassador 's prime concern now : |||O O O O O O O 
one day he hopes to teach again back home . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
richard roth , cnn , united nations . |||O O O O O O O O 
we 'll try to track his progress and see if he 's able to do that , ambassador aldouri . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

for others , the stories can be seen in their injuries . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
nobody knows these stories better than the devil docs , naval corpsmen who never look the other way , but rather face what needs to be done without flinching . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are often the first faces the injured see , be they iraqi or coalition force members . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even while statutes were coming down and there was dancing in the streets , the consequences of continuing firefights are seen here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O

their stories could be seen in the shrapnel wounds of rocket -propelled grenades and bullet wounds from semi-automatic weapons . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the operations are on their hands , abdomen and face . |||O O O O O O O O O O O

we return now to my interview earlier today with the united states defense secretary , donald rumsfeld . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blitzer i know during the war , before the war , you were very concerned about the position of the syrian government , cooperating with iraqis , having an open border , if you will . |||O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
has the situation improved , especially in the aftermath now of the secretary of state 's meeting with bashar al - asad ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
well , i guess time will tell . |||O O O O O O O O 
i talked to secretary powell this morning on the phone a bit , and it 's not , i think you need to let the dust settle on that . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's , in my judgment , had a visit that was worth doing , and the president asked him to do it , and it was the right thing to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll see what progress comes . |||O O O O O O O 
you know , words are one thing , actions are another . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but right now you 're open - minded as far as syria on whether they will crack down on terrorism , take some of the other steps that you want them to take ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know what they 've been doing , and it 's been unhelpful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know that secretary powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful , and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in my view , they were making some unwise decisions previously . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what they 'll do after this visit remains to be seen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the secretary of state has written you a letter expressing , apparently , some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be spending , those detained at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay in cuba , about 600 or so of them . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is there any movement in trying to determine the fate of these individuals ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think that 's quite accurate as to what he wrote me about . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
all right , tell me what ... |||O O O O O O O 
i think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter -agency process , where we have all these fbi and department of justice and cia and dia , and what have you , involved in interrogating these detainees , it takes time to find out what intelligence they have . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate , and what colin and i have been concerned about , both of us , is that it 's taking so long . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are a number of countries , and the department of state has the responsibility of dealing with those countries , that have foreign nationals in gitmo , in guantanamo bay , cuba , being detained , and those countries , understandably , would like to know when they could have those people.so the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do you want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back , to have parades in new york , washington , elsewhere ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's no question but that the troops , the young men and women , did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them , and there will be . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and general franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world , and indeed for the iraqi people , who have been liberated . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what 's the best way to do that ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
in the case of 1991 , the task was to go in and get them out of kuwait , and they did it , and they were properly greeted coming back to the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O 
in this instance , it was a very different task . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was to remove that regime , and it 's part of a global war on terrorism that is not over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O 
we still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist , that work with those global networks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and on the one hand we will , in fact , find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women , and we 'll do it well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing , i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i kind of doubt it , because it 's such a different circumstance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
certainly , our war plan was not modeled off of 1991 . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
one final question on north korea . |||O O O O O O O 
if the north koreans pursue their nuclear weapons ambitions ... |||O O O O O O O O O O 
blitzer ... a preemptive strike , is that something that is out there ? |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not one who speculates about things like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know that back in the 1990s , in the clinton administration , secretary perry called in the former secretaries of defense , and we had a discussion , and they clearly had teed up a military option that they were considering , and they then at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that that was not appropriate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but those are very serious issues , and i leave them for the president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

welcome back to late edition . |||O O O O O O 
joining us now are two key members of the united states senate foreign relations committee . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in his home state of indiana , the committee 's chairman , republican senator richard lugar . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and here in washington , democratic senator christopher dodd of connecticut . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
senators , welcome back to late edition . |||O O O O O O O O 
mr. chairman , let me begin with you . |||O O O O O O O O O 
are you among those who are beginning to conclude that , when all the dust settles , the u.s. may not find weapons of mass destruction in iraq ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sen . richard lugar ( r ) , indiana |||O O O O O O O O O 
no , i concur with secretary powell , secretary rumsfeld , the president , that weapons of mass destruction are there , and likewise , that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and , likewise , the intellectual capital that is there to produce more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because not much else is -- you do n't need much to get it going again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that , i think , we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they do n't re-enter the business , much as we did with russian scientists under the nunn - lugar program . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what about you , senator dodd , do you believe , in the end , they will find weapons of mass destruction ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sen . christopher dodd ( d ) , connecticut |||O O O O O O O O O 
i have no evidence to the contrary . |||O O O O O O O O 
and certainly , they have used them in the past . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's no doubt about that at all , both in iran and against the kurdish population . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some got out of the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it would n't surprise me to hear that . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but i 'm going to work on the assumption , based on the intelligence that has been gathered , that the weapons of mass destruction existed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , you know , they 've used it in the past , and i think the point that senator lugar just made -- certainly having the intellectual capacity to do this was proven already by the fact they 've used them in the past . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , i would n't dwell on that point specifically , because saddam hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity , and the world is a safer place today because he 's not ruling iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blitzer will the u.s. lose creditability , mr. chairman , if , if the u.s. finds no hard evidence , no so - called smoking gun ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , we have full credibility in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we 've prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the iraqi people , and we have clearly caused saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction , or at least to suppress evidence of them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is a victory of sorts.this is a facet that 's important . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's important in the war against terrorism that we rout out whatever is there and , likewise , the people involved , because they might help supply al qaeda or other terrorists along the trail . |||O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blitzer senator dodd , how important is it for the u.s. to conclusively learn what happened to saddam hussein ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i do n't think it 's as important as finding osama bin laden , for the simple reason that i do n't think saddam hussein today poses any threat , wherever he is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if he is alive , obviously , he does n't pose the kind of threat that an osama bin laden does with his cellular network around the world to reactivate al qaeda and international terrorism . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
so , it would certainly be good to know where he is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it would be , certainly , to know , to apprehend him , to bring him before a court of justice . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
but i do n't think it 's absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find out what happened to him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
and you agree with that assessment , mr. chairman ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
lugar yes , i think that senator dodd is right on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
interview with donald rumsfeld ; lugar , dodd talk about post -war iraq ; kissinger , cohen discuss middle east road map |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what about the length of the u.s. military presence in iraq , senator lugar ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how long do you anticipate large numbers of u.s. troops will remain there ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lugar well , i was heartened by what secretary rumsfeld told you in the last interview , that we will have troops there as long as necessary , but no longer than necessary . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that 's a pretty good way to state it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are trying to pass that on to others . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
likewise , the other government 's procedures , the fledgling beginnings on democracy , and all the rest . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but that 's going to require an undergirding . |||O O O O O O O O O 
now , in due course , as everybody points out , we may get help from other countries . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we may bring in nato allies or the united nations or other people in the arab world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but for the moment , this is our responsibility . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and we ought not to be having large debates about how rapidly we move out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i was upset , in a way , to hear reports that by the fall , three divisions out of five would be gone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think secretary rumsfeld disabused us of that today . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and what about you , senator dodd , not only the length of time , but the cost to u.s. taxpayers ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
have you been given any ballpark estimate what this is going to cost the united states ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , what we 've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $ 100 billion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we put $ 2.5 billion in , in the last supplemental appropriations bill . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it 's going to be costly . |||O O O O O O O O 
these rfps , these seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly , and so it 's going to be expensive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally on the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , i would hope that sooner rather than later we could see a civilian government emerge in iraq , a democratically elected one , that there 'd be more cooperation from the international community , on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuring that 's necessary in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and to the extent we can move that along more quickly , i think we 're all going to be better off . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
being the sole , or almost the sole power there , both in terms of reconstruction and politically , exposes us to great vulnerabilities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blitzer senator lugar , we have to take a quick break , but before we do , i wanted to just ask you , the u.n. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
role -- you say there could be a u.n. role . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you specifically want the united nations to have some sort of peacekeeping role there ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and secondarily , what about countries like france , germany , and russia , which opposed the bush administration 's war plans , do you want them shut out ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
no , i do n't want anybody shut out . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and i do hope the united nations will play a vital role in iraq , whether it be in peacekeeping or various other ways , and i hope that that will occur soon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think we really need an internationalization of the process , for the very reasons that senator |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're going to take that quick break . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we have a lot more ground to cover . |||O O O O O O O O O 
senators lugar and dodd will be staying with us . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they 'll also be taking your phone calls . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI

the story behind the defendants of tulia , texas , is our " headlines timeline . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
july 23rd , 1999 -- there was a massive drug bust in a predominately african-american neighborhood in tulia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of the 46 people arrested , 39 are african-american . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
the case against them was based on the testimony of undercover officer thomas coleman . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coleman claimed he bought drugs from the defendants , but offered little or no supporting evidence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after the first of several trials ended with convictions and harsh sentences , most of the other defendants pleaded guilty to avoid hard time . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
march 17 , 2003 -- with coleman 's credibility under serious attack , new hearings for the tulia defendants get under way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
the hearings are stopped when the judge , defense attorneys and prosecutors agree that coleman lied under oath and is a racist . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coleman denies doing anything wrong . |||O O O O O O

bonnaroo is kind of this going example of what the whole jam band community is turned in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's what i really like about the jam community . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's acceptance of improvizational music , dpes pit whatever region or gen re . it 's about the freedom of the music and the freedom of expression . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , we sold all 80,000 tickets through our web site . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we sold out in 16 days . |||O O O O O O O 
i mean , the amazing thing is , we used no traditional advertising . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we put all these bands together . |||O O O O O O O 
it draws a huge audience . |||O O O O O O 
so the record companies and the music business has to take all of these forms of music more seriously . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's like strength in numbers . |||O O O O O O O 
i hope this kind of thing can happen in america , instead of it just being these isolated festivals like bonnaroo , it really can happen in 100 cities every summer , like the festivals do in europe . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my only complaint is the overlapping . |||O O O O O O O 
you know , as a music lover that i am , there 's five acts all playing at the same time on five different stages that i want to see . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it really comes from the actual bands and the fact that there 's this grassroots following that 's been there , you know , for a long time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
primarily started by the grateful dead , at least the future by the grateful dead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we will get 0 by we will survive |||O O O O O O O O 
we 're carrying on a tradition that started a long time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in american music , improvization is what it 's always been arped . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's not just clapping and having a good time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it makes you feel a certain kind of love , and hopefully , that translates in the community . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but it took some four months before they were able to get a picture and identify the picture as this brian david mitchell and then his wife , wanda barzee . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the other questions , of course , are why did n't elizabeth smart try to escae ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
were there opportunities perhaps that she might ab vible to -- able to get away from her abductors ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the police are saying she was abducted by knife point and was an opportunity and may have been some kind of fear factor going on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are seeing a lot locally here some photographs that are coming out that show the three , that show mitchell , his wife , and who they believe to be elizabeth smart at a party in september . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what does this mean if you 're traveling you might ask . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to cnn 's patty davis at reagan national airport . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
what are travelers to do and , for that matter , not to do ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : miles , what that means is tighter security at airports across the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that could potentially slow you down . |||O O O O O O O O 
some things you may want to do is , first all , just get here a little bit early . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , homeland security chief tom ridge described some of those new security measures on top of the ones that are already in place . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begin the training for the pilots in the cockpits with firearms . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

you come outside the airline -- the airplane itself and you have technology , 100 % inspection of baggage . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you have new trained inspectors for passengers . |||O O O O O O O O 
you enhance airport security outside the perimeter . |||O O O O O O O O

back to something kelly wallace said . |||O O O O O O O 
she was talking about the somewhat blase attitude of israelis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we were lacking at the front page of the jerusalem post the other day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the big banner headline that day big and bold , was president bush issues ultimatum . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the side column , as an afterthought , sit tense told to carry gas masks wherever they go . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it gives you a sense of , perhaps what 50 years of tension and war will do to your mentality . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
but it does also say that the israelis are a bit more blase , if that 's a fair word for it , than perhaps we are . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
president bush , when he talked earlier to reporters , mentioned that this effort is an effort , this war is an effort to make the homeland , our homeland , more secure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john king , that whole issue of homeland security must be so much on the minds of so many government officials , given the level of the terror alert today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : so far , so good is the assessment we 're getting from senior administration officials as they try to track what they worry about most . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as we have the strikes overseas throughout iraq , there will be retaliatory terror strikes , either by organized terrorist networks or sympathetic terrorists or people against the united states in this country . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no plans , we 're told , to raise the threat level , though it 's already at orange , which is high . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so microsoft of the president 's business has been behind the scenes today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's the most senior of about a handful of senior administration officials , including the vice president and the secretary of state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the national security advisor fanning out , we 're told in phone calls to more than three dozen world leaders offering them an update on what is going on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but we did here hear from the president a bit earlier today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we see baghdad , a capitol under siege . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
mr . bush in the cabinet room at the white house to portray a different image , trying to show in washington , it 's business as usual , urgent business as , but still business as usual with secretary of defense rumsfeld on one side , secretary of state powell on the other . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the president offered a brief statement in the cabinet room . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
call my cabinet together to review our strategies , to make the world more peaceful , to make our country more secure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to make the lives of our citizens as healthy and as prosperous as possible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we heard from secretary rumsfeld who briefed us on the early stages of the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
there is no question we 've set the finest of our citizens into harm 's way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they performed with great skill and great bravery . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we thank their loved ones . |||O O O O O O 
we heard from secretary powell who briefed us on the ever - growing coalition of the willing , nations who support our deep desire for peace and freedom . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
over 40 nations now support our efforts . |||O O O O O O O O 
we 're grateful for their determination . |||O O O O O O O 
we appreciate their vision , and we welcome their support . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
as well , we discussed the need to make sure we have plans in place to encourage economic vitality and growth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we will continue to push for a medicare system compassionate for your seniors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we care deeply about the fact that some children in our society ca n't read . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we want the best of education for every citizen in america . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this cabinet is confident about the future of our country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're confident we can achieve our objectives . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm grateful for their service to their country . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : so even at the very early stages of a defining moment of bush presidency , the president trying to make the case his eyes and especially the eyes of his cabinet still on the domestic affairs of the united states as the early prosecution of the war continues . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
one thing the president said that will be the point of contention around the world , the president called it an ever- growing coalition of 40 countries . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is handful more nations that were actively involved in the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for the persian gulf war , but there is a significant difference , of course . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
in this coalition , it ips the united states doing the overwhelming load of the fighting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
british forces on the ground , australian troops scheduled to take part , perhaps in some way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the last gulf war , you had arab forces on the ground . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
the egyptians , syrians , saudis , qataris taking up arms to expel the iraqi armiy kuwait . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no such participation this time around . |||O O O O O O O 
abc the president says , this is a growing coalition , this is one of the big geo political debates going on around the world as the president |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we are watching activity in baghdad . |||O O O O O O O 
while we do , we want to tell you marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of nasiriyah face stiff resistance from iraqi paramilitary groups today . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for some perspective , let 's turn to miles o' brien with retired air force general don shepperd . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
if you are going to fight on the ground , you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a lot of bridges between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s. forces are now and their ultimate destination , downtown baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have the city laid out for you here . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
how many bridges in this city alone ? |||O O O O O O O O 
in this map we have right here , 13 major bridges in downtown baghdad , including the expressway bridge over here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
three bridges here attaching east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is one technique , one possible way u.s. forces might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defended by iraqis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let 's look at the animation . |||O O O O O O O 
it does n't really matter for this scenario that we 're laying out here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this would be representing m1 - a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O 
you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
as we turn the other direction , what you 'll see are these iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have burns in front of them . |||O O O O O O O O 
artillery behind them firing back . |||O O O B-TRI O O 
and then they there goes the smoke screen . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces fire ing at you from being able to see . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
it obscures you but also obscures them . |||O O O O O O O O 
he comes in and wants to identify his target and he 's got a big -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ca n't see through the smoke . |||O O O O O O O 
we 've got some techniques we 're going to show you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
somewhere near we can put down special |||O O O O O O O

on we go in the meantime . |||O O O O O O O 
again , today , there were disturbing hints , and we underscore hints here , that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
yesterday the story centered on intelligence regarding enemy intentions . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
today the evidence is somewhat more tangible . |||O O O O O O O O 
reporting for us , cnn 's david ensor . |||O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : the evidence is accumulating that iraq may be planning to use chemical weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
gas masks turning up in abandoned trenches . |||O O O O O O O O 
in nasiriyah in a building marked as a hospital u.s. |||O O O O O O O O O O 
marines found weapons , atropine antidote kits , and that was not all . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of iraqi military uniforms . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : the findings are heightening concerns among coalition forces approaching baghdad since , as the iraqis should know , u.s. and british forces do not use chemical weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u.s. and allied troops cross it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
there is also intelligence , officials say , suggesting republican guard units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there has been intelligence scraps , who knows how accurate they are , chatter in the system , that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to baghdad and tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : in baghdad deputy prime minister tariq aziz repeated his government 's stand -- it does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when they started to talk about the weapons of mass destruction , we know and we always knew that that was fabrication and lines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : experts say saddam hussein 's forces will likely try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have , hoping to build international pressure on the u.s. and britain to back down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be counterproductive to saddam , because it would only galvanize international |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we 're getting late word tonight that geraldo rivera may not be be kicked out of iraq after all . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O 
originally the central command said the veteran fox news correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he 's been embedded with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now a spokesman from the central command is saying and i 'm quoting " frankly , we have bigger and more important things to do . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
during a live broadcast geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
says he 's not aware he 's being expelled but says if so , it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at msnbc blew the whistle on him . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it sounds to me like some rats at my former network , nbc , are spreading some lies about me . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , they ca n't compete fair and square on the battlefield so they 're trying to stab me in the back . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is not first time . |||O O O O O O 
the central command on the other hand says rivera is being kicked out of iraq because " he gave away the big picture stuff . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all of this now under review , whether or not geraldo stays or goes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O

nbc is terminating freelancer reporter peter arnett for statements he made to the iraqi media . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we showed you the statements yesterday . |||O O O O O O O 
he said the coalition 's first war plan had failed because of iraqi resistance . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
today he appeared on on nbc 's " today " show and said he was sorry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i want to apologize to the american people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an interview to iraqi television . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , i said in that interview essentially what we all know about the war , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but clearly by giving that interview to iraqi television , i created a firestorm in the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and for that i am truly sorry . |||O O O O O O O O 
arnett had been covering the war for national geographic , which also fired him as tv reports were given exclusively to nbc and msnbc. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
late word from london that the tabloid the daily mirror just hired peter arnett to be its correspondent in baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
but the question remains did peter arnett and geraldo rivera cross the line ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
or were they within their rights as reporters ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
we posed that question to michael wolf , a contributing editor for " new york " magazine , a media columnist , an important article in the new issue of " new york . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

bombardment of baghdad continues tonight and over the past 20 minutes , explosions rocking baghdad , central baghdad southern baghdad , the outskirts of baghdad , and importantly , as the coalition forces , principally u.s. army forces , move against saddam hussein international airport -- which is about ten miles outside the center of baghdad -- those explosions are intensifies . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if we may again going to the wide screen of what appears to me to be abu dhabi television that is providing this picture , 3:20 a.m. in baghdad , live pictures again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that it is very difficult to discern whether or not that is , in point of fact , the missiles that we have become accustomed to striking baghdad and its environs , or whether it is the large 2,000 pound jdam bombs that have been striking targets sclected by the coalition in baghdad , or whether these flashes now represent artillery barrages as fighting continues to take control of the -- to take control of saddam international airport . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
again , correspondents , our correspondents with the -- embedded with these forces , with them in the field , saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline of baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
over the course of the past two weeks , since this war began , something like 23,000 coalition sorties have been flown , and over the course of the past 24 hours , 1,900 sorties flown . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we are told that , of those , 850 were strike sorties , motor vehicle most of those directed against the republican guard . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as you know , the republican guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam hussein 's regime , in principal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
two of those divisions absolutely devastated , destroyed . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the so - called medina division , and the baghdad division . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the baghdad division , of course , getting its name from the fact that it is the republican guard division designated to defend principally baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
four other divisions we are told have also been hit very , very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units va also been hit very hard . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
so we are seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that raises questions , questions that have been in front of us since that first strike on march 19th against the location that the cia military intelligence thought was a place where saddam hussein , perhaps his sons , were . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's called aldergrove , just outside belfast . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the president of the united states coming for a brief two - day summit with the british prime minister tony blair . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
they 'll be talking about a postwar iraq among other important subjects . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 'll also have an opportunity to review the so - called road map for israeli / palestinian peace negotiations to get off the ground . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they also want to review what the status is of northern ireland right now as that peace process seems to be taking hold . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
been relatively quiet in northern ireland over the past few years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is the third time in as many weeks that president bush and prime minister blair will be sitting down to review station , war strategy , as they go forward together . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
go forward as close allies in trying to help put together a new iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are some significant differences in their strategy , including what role precisely the united nations should have in determining the future of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 'll try to thrash all of that out . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you 're look at the picture of air force one taxiing in on the tarmac , getting ready for the president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as we watched this picture of the air force one getting into this airport i want to bring in our military analyst general dan crisman to go over what happens happening in baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
seems pretty far away from belfast right now , general . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but decisions that these two leaders make could have a significant impact on the future of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
first of all , general , we 'll keep this picture up of air force one , talk about what you sense is happening on the streets of baghdad right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wolf , it 's clearly the final phase . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the engame which is unfoaling right now . |||O O O O O O O O 
i think it 's very significant not only in baghdad but basra itself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you have coalition forces there in some strength . |||O O O O O O O O O 
apparently three ba talians of the u.s. 3rd division in baghdad three coalition assets , three huge battle groups in basra itself which the u.k. has there , what they 've developed here , wolf , over the last several weeks i very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what the final remnants of the regime leadership are in terms of where they are embedded in the cities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what they 're doing is going in now , very carefully , obviously some symbolic raids against palaces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
but the more important presence is to go after what intelligence delivers and that 's where these key leaders are located . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're going to be defended fanatically but intelligence is so crucial from aerial platforms and special ops personnel to give the three assets the intel which they need to close with and eliminate final remnants of the regime in those citys . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
this is a very important final phase here , wolf , and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly than we anticipated . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as we continue to watch air force one , now on the ground outside belfast , northern ireland , we 'll be watching president bush emerge from the plane momentarily . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll continue to have live coverage of that . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
when walter rodgers , our embedded reporter with the 3-7th cavalry says three battalions of troops are on the ground , inside baghdad itself , have taken up positions they 're going to spend the night there presumably , how many soldiers are we talking about right now ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the task forces really , wolf are probably built around the m - 2 bradley the basic infantry fighting vehicle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is the equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's cannon , it 's ability to implace troops and fire through the firing ports in that bradley vehicle to take them in under protection . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a very , very important piece of equipment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
these are probably mechanized heavy task forces that have overhead aerial platforms to provide direct support . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's significant the degradation of the iraqi air defenses has allowed a - 10s , predators , u -s , other assets to hover and loiter and provide the overhead protection to these task |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

welcome back n case you 're just tuning in , our top story this hour , the discovery of suspect chemical weapons materials at an agricultural complex in central iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
troops from the u.s. army 's 101st airborne division went to the site on friday , finding a number of large drums buried in bunkers . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the general benjamin frankly of the 101st says today a more sophisticated test indicated the presence of nerve and blister agents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he says that type of test that is required sometimes shows false -positives and further testing will be done to determine whether the materials are indeed nonweaponized chemical agents or perhaps simply pesticides . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
general frankly says it is hard to believe u.n. inspectors would have found the facility hidden as deeply as it was near the euphrates river . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we 're going to pause for a second to see if we see the president hopping off this chopper . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as you probably know , the prime minister of the great britain has been under great pressure at home and much of europe to support giving the united nations a very strong role in stabilizing iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the white house had signaled consistently it wants the united states and great britain to create a lead role . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we learned from john king , traveling with the president , that the new iraq run neither by u.s. / british coalition or united nations , but by the iraqi people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that some of what the prime minister and president shared with reporters at news conference following their meetings . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the president went on to say that an interim authority composed of iraq grs inside and outside the country will run iraq until a permanent government can be established . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you want to hang with the shot ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
okay , we 're going to stay with this shot . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll talk more about what the two leaders discussed at the joint news conference following their series of meetings . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
they really wanted to let folks who had any concerns about what the u.n. involvement might be to not worry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they said there will definitely be some kind of role for the united nations , they think it 's very important for the european nations to be on board with the plan , but once again , they very much view the future of iraq as being that in iraqi hands . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we begin we will finish . |||O O O O O O 
[ applause ] d the extra $ 400 per child to american families this year , 2003 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a family of four with an income of $ 40,000 would receive a 96 % reduction in federal income taxes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
instead of paying $ 1,178 per year , the family would pay $ 45 a year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ applause ] that means extra money in the family budget year after year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that money can cover a lot of bills . |||O O O O O O O O O 
that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that money will be in circulation , which will be good for our economy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and , as importantly , from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most small businesses are sole proprietorships , limited partnerships , are subchapter ss , and , therefore , when you reduce individual tax rates , you benefit small business formation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as a matter of fact , under this plan , some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
which leaves more money for investment , more money for growth , more money for job creation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a growing economy also needs small business investment . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and our tax code should encourage investment . |||O O O O O O O O 
today a small business can deduct a maximum of $ 25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increased to $ 75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
by doing so , we promote greater investment in machinery . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company 's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ applause ] we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it would encourage more investment in american businesses . |||O O O O O O O O O 
economists say that this plan will help our stock markets , and since half of american families own stock , the reform will help them save and help our economy grow . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , these measures were presented to congress in the first week of this year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the pro growth package was urgent in january . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's even more urgent today . |||O O O O O O O 
[ applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create -- [ applause ] will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in two years time , this nation has experienced war , a recession and a national emergency . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
which has caused our government to run a deficit . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy , which means more revenues to our treasury , and less spending in washington , d.c. [ applause ] |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we need at least $ 550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people , the more jobs we will create in this economy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ applause ] the last few months have been a time of challenge for america . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our resolve has been tested . |||O O O O O O 
yet we have the great resources of national strength . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
to overcome every challenge we face . |||O O O O O O O 
our confidence an our optimism have never waivered . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we are defending the peace of the world . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we 're bringing freedom to corners of the world who have n't seen freedom in years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're all building the prosperity of our country . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a unique moment in our history and the american people are rising to meet it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i want to thank each of you for your hard work . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i want to thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country 's future . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
may god bless you , and may god continue to bless america . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this was the italian ship that was taken -- that was captured by palestinian terrorists back in 1985 and some may remember the story of leon clinghover , he was in a cheal chair and the terrorists shot him and pushed him over the side of the ship into the mediterranean where he obviously , died . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O

the coroner examining the remains of two bodies recovered near san francisco bay yesterday was unable to determine the cause of death . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
police are now considering the possibility that the remains are those of laci peterson and her unborn child . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
peterson disappeared on christmas eve of last year . |||O O O O O O O O O 
paul vercammen joins me now from martinez , california , with the latest for us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : well , lou , one thing that the coroner has been able to determine is that the skeletal remains are those of one , an adult female , and two , the remains of the almost full - term baby boy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and of course , this is significant because laci peterson , when she disappeared from her modesto home , was 7 1 / 2 months pregnant . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that was on christmas eve . her husband , scott , at the time said that he was fishing in the berkeley marina . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , in a strange twist in all of this , just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone , and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this person came across the bone at the shore . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
he brought it home and contacted the authorities , and we took possession of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and you 're trying to connect it to the other -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , we 're trying to find out if it 's a human bone and whether or not it is related to the others . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link , there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now this case is also taking on a rather , we should say , almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they 're going to bring in an expert on what 's called alufating decay , and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is in the damage aspect of it . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the remains of the almost full - term baby boy were inside the female 's remains at the time of death . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
also , the coroner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeletons , for example , if they could see the bone compromised in some way they could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O 
we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's because modesto police have scheduled a news conference and while they may not say much at all they could also drop some major bomb shells , lou . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporting live from martinez , california , i 'm paul vercammen , now back to you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul , let me ask you , if i may , quickly , are we expecting -- is there any reason for us to expect that there would be the ability to identify those remains as a result of these autopsies this afternoon ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : it sounds like all of this will be too quick , and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's particularly important for the adult female remains . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
so now they 're going to have to turn to dna , and that 's why they 're calling in these experts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some dna testing can be very quick , but sometimes it can take up to weeks , even more , lou . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul vercammen , thank you very much . |||O O O O O O O O 
as paul just reported , the modesto , california police department will be holding a news conference just a few minutes from now , and cnn of course will be carrying that news conference live . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we were talking about the road map to middle east peace and ran a footage about the chicken and these dogs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the golden real estate treever on the left had a litter of pups and the chicken got in the pen , a real story , they 're all hanging out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it looks as though the puppies in one of the shots is trying to get lunch from the chicken . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is what they 're doing , jack ! |||O O O O O O O O O 
we got a lot of e-mails to us on the east coast who do n't know about the farm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can not nurse a chicken . |||O O O O O O O 
the question should be what is the chicken getting out of this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't want to go there . |||O O O O O O O O 
i.k. in new jersey a buyology teacher , i can tell you without hesitation , a chicken can not be nursed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
only mammals that have distinct biological feature . |||O O O O O O O O

any farm kid knows that certain animals can not see for a few days after they 're born , including puppies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the puppies try to nurse the chicken hen . |||O O O O O O O O O 
they do that by feel , not sight . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a chicken hen is warm and comfortable , so they try their luck and eventually feel their way back to the mother dog where things work out better for them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

that 's a lot of shares and a lot of money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
andy serwer 's look into that and the mark muz . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you 're investing , why now ? |||O O O O O O O O 
chitchat in the time life building here at aol and all over wall street , ted turner selling 60 million shares for $ 800 million , more than half of his stake in the company , he opens 40 million plus now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think he 's begin up . |||O O O O O O O 
he 's at least -- hedging his bets by keeping 40 million shares but basically he 's decided that the company is not going wait he wants it to go and he 's bailing out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , a lot of concern obviously by people who still own the stock . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my point about this , if ted turner were so smart and he 's a very smart guy but he did not sell at the top , okay ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he did n't sell at $ 60 . |||O O O O O O O O 
hind sight would have like to have gotten that . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
he believed in the merger like most other people did . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
we 'll look back five years from now , you can see , he has lost a lot of money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , he still had $ 1.7 billion , we 're not shedding tears . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he did have $ 8 billion . |||O O O O O O O 
he 's left a lot on the table . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll look back five years from now and say , when the stock is either at $ 13 still or $ 8 or $ 30 and say , he was either very smart or not smart at all . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's still hedging his bet by keeping 40 million stake . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the question , i 'm an aol shareholder sitting at home , hearing this news , done this set off a few alarms ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
will people panic and everybody sell it ? |||O O O O O O O O

again , you know , the stock has drifted below $ 10 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's been in the neighborhood for a while . |||O O O O O O O O O O

talking about bill bennet this morning one of the country 's leading crusaders for morality author of " virtues " and admits he has a gambling problem . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
me he made the admission after bennett lost up to $ 8 million in casinos in the last decade . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the articles say he won at times that he had $ 200,000 lines of credit at several laying casinos . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gambling , however , is not one of of of the vices bennett thinks is undermining american culture . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

he does say he 's going to stop . |||O O O O O O O O O

we 'll continue to watch this cramma unfold off key largo in florida . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let 's much on to another important story . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's happened , of course , several times during the war in iraq , journalists caught in the line of fire and killed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
israeli troops are facing a similar situation with two journalists killed in just the past two weeks . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
reporter : friday night in the gaza strip and a journalist is about to lose his life . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
shortly after several shots are heard an israeli bulldozer can be seen uncovering the israelis say , a tunnel used to smuggle weapons . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
moments later , three journalists who were covering that israeli action appear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one with tv labeled on the back of a bullet - proof vest , another carrying a white flag . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
judging from the videotape , they appear difficult to see in the darkness . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after the journalists shout , another gunshot . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O 
moments later , another shot and the sound of someone in pain. |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
34 - year - old british journalist james miller died on the scene after israeli soldiers come to his aid , the israeli defense sources says . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he is best known for his work on two award - winning documentaries which appeared on cnn exposing the world to the taliban rule in afghanistan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now the foreign press association in israel is calling for an independent investigation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
so , again , to know exactly what happened we need a full - fledged inquiry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the israeli government said it s forces were returning fire and that miller was shot in the back , suggesting he could have been hit by palestinian gunmen . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
those close to miller believe he was shot by an armored israeli personnel carrier . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
we know the israelis fired . |||O O O O B-TRI O 
whether or not he was shot by israelis gunfire , we are not certain at this time . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
miller becomes the second journalist in just two weeks to be killed covering the israeli-palestinian conflict. |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
with palestinian cameramen , shot and killed by an israeli soldier on the west bank in mid-april . |||O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
with back - to - back deaths making a total of at least seven journalists killed covering the conflict in the past two and a half years . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is very worrying and i believe the israeli army should take special measures to prevent this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the message from the israeli government is that its soldiers are not targeting journalists , but that journalists who travel to places where there could be live fire exchange between israeli forces and palestinian gunmen have a responsibility to take greater precautions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have to realize that this is not a game going on there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a life and death situation . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O 
soldiers are basically thinking about their own lives at that moment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they do n't have time to hesitate . |||O O O O O O O O 
the israeli spokesman says the soldier his no choice , but to be there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i want to thank the president for spain 's diplomatic support before the conflict . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
[ translator speaking ] and for the use of spanish air space and bases as the war grew closer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O

[ translator speaking ] both spain and the united states are committed to a stable , democratic and peaceful future for the people of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ translator speaking ] spain has shown that commitment by sending engineering and medical units to help the people of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

[ translator speaking ] today , i have moved to ease sanctions imposed by the united states against iraq 's old government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ translator speaking ] first based on the authority recently given to me by congress i 'm suspending the iraq 's sanctions act , which restricts the export of certain commitment necessary for iraq 's reconstruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ translator speaking ] secondly , 'm directing the secretary to relax sanctions on american countries and citizens conducting business in iraq that contributed to humanitarian reconstruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ translator speaking ] soon , at the u.n. security council , the united states , great britain and spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions imposed by the united nations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ translator speaking ] the regime that the sanctions were directed against no longer rules iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

[ translator speaking ] we believe that the people of spain like everywhere have a right to live free from terror . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

he said he found evidence that hussein 's day of reckoning well over due . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
christopher hitchens joins us from california . |||O O O O O O O 
good to have you with us . |||O O O O O O O 
your journey , particularly to southern iraq , what is evoked there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history of this regime . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
give us your insights as to what you think the future holds . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you mean if i start with the past ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
not much of a trip . |||O O O O O O 
i was n't up the sharp end . |||O O O O O O O O 
i was n't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bagdad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , saddam hussein made the only self criticism . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said , i could either invade kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
maybe before the weapon and then later he said , oh , i should have got the nuclear weapon before i invaded . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
he was right about that . |||O O O O O O 
but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen -year 's war where the united states could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we 're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in '91 when it could have been finished . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
should have taken the side of the rebels then . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
taken the risk of supporting a shiite insurrection at that point . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
helping the kurds , removing the regime . |||O O O O O O O O 
we 'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we 'd done that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that seems to be the core of the argument . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
as you point out , of course , for the fact of the matter is , the mistakes of saddam hussein made possible his removal from power ultimately . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the mistakes of the united states , again , as you point out , norman schwarzkopf making a peace , permitting helicopters to fly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
still hurts me to read this . |||O O O O O O O 
the little town i was in this southern iraq , as far as i got , i ca n't boast of further , is where the talks took place . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
we have the transcript of the meeting . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O 
they say , okay , we have lost this round . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and he says , yeah , that 's all right . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they ask again , are you sure they mean that ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they ca n't believe the luck . |||O O O O O O O 
they use the gunships to kill , we think , not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern iraq and trying to do that to the kurds , as well , so it was a knife edge . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and it 's not just been wise after the event , i believe , to say that there was an argument in realtime between the bush administration members . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mr . cheney 's the only one i know that changed his mind . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most of those that took the view at that time , think until recently they were correct in saving saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course , mr . cheney was in the chain of command with swars cough and -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when they made the decision not to move toward bagdad with bad information . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
namely , the republican guard absolutely devastated . |||O O O O O O O O 
yes . and , well , we know now the harvest of all that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it hurts to think of how many wonderful people in iraq at the academic community , lawyers , human rights activists , civilians , intellectuals , people -- would now be alive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights . |||O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mistakes made then , mistakes part of human experience , but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is it your sense that the united states is on the right track ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that there is the prospect here a commitment here on the part of the united states to |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

leung 's lawyers wasted little time responding to the grand jury indictment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
katrina leung is no matt aharry , as people have suggested . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she was recruited actively by the fbi because of what she could do and because of what she knew . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she d not go out to get this job . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : leung , a prominent chinese- american , was practically the toast of l.a . she was seemingly present for just about every event involving local politicians , sometimes national ones , and various high - ranking officials of the chinese government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that part , at least , was by design . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
leung was hired by the fbi and paid almost $ 2 million over 20 years to spy on the chinese . |||O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
federal prosecutors now say she pulled a fast one and actually spied on the u.s. for the chinese . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

there 's some shocking new information about the life of john f. kennedy , both before and during his days in the white house . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the revelations are part of a just published biography about the 35th president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our jonathan karl takes a look inside the pages . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : the revelations about kennedy 's alleged affair with an intern make up just a couple lines in historian robert dowd 's 700 - plus page biography . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the information comes from a single source , an interview with a former kennedy staffer who says she does not remember the intern 's last game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although he finds the reports of kennedy 's womanizing credible , he believes new information about kennedy 's health problems is more significant . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jfk 's public image was one of youthful vigor but in truth he battled serious medical problems his entire life . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
twice before becoming president he was so sick , a priest was brought in to give him last rites . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while researching his new book on jfk , dallic uncovered previously sealed medical records that detailed the ek tent of his medical troubles and the lengths he went to conceal them from the public . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are many stories about politicians who used political influence to get out of military conflict . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but dallic shows he youed his family 's influence to get into the navy just as america was on the verge of world war ii . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
in 1941 , he flunked two military medical exams . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
his powerful father intervened , getting yet another exam . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
reading the report of his exam , one would think he never had a serious physical problem in his life . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a complete whitewash that would never have been possible without his father 's help . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kennedy entered the navy earning hero status for saving his ship mates when his boat pt - 109 was sunk by the japanese . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
dallek says kennedy 's brushes with death , combined with his t deaths of his sister and brother , fueled the ambition to led him to become the youngest person elected president in american history . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O

let 's check in with our rusty dornin , out in modesto , california , with the latest on that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : we knew it was a matter of time before police got back into the water in san francisco bay looking for more evidence in the laci peterson case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

right across the channel here is an area known as brooks island . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they believe -- police say that is where scott peterson told them that he did go fishing the day that laci peterson did disappear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
now , a source close to the investigation has told me that what they are really looking for are concrete anchors or weights which may have parts of laci peterson 's body or clothing or something attached to it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that they did discover a concrete weight in scott peterson 's wearhouse . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if it matched , that would be something that could link scott peterson -- it would be like a smoking gun in this case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in defense of carrot top , he knows he 's insane and annoying and acknowledges it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he wrote carrot top is one of those c list celebrities who wormed their way into your consciousness without you knowing how it happened . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here 's a story about a kid who 's stormed into our consciousness , lebron james . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the high school basketball phenom out of ohio . |||O O O O O O O O O 
he just signed , only 18 , a senior , has not played one nanosecond in the nba yet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yet already signed a sneaker deal that ap reports is worth more than $ 90 million . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lebron james is expected to be cleveland 's top pick after they won the number one pick in the nba lottery . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nike is hoping the phenom will help boost their sales of basketball shoes to that crucial team market . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and of course everybody 's got an opinion whether the kid is going to skip college and go right into the pros , worth this kind of money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they only paid tiger woods $ 40 million for his deal coming out of stanford university . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but he had an amateur golf career where he posted scores and did things comparable to what is done on the pga tour . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nobody knows if this kid can play against shaquille o'neal or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nike and nba are looking for the next big thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's not only of course his basketball skills , which is unquestionable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then if in fact the team he ultimately plays on , whether the cleveland cavaliers , or somebody else , whether they actually are any good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
name the starting five of of the cavaliers . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i ca n't , that 's my point . |||O O O O O O O O O 
they had the lowest attendance in the nba . |||O O O O O O O O O

as we said , earlier this week , christine todd whitman stepped doup and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped down , the job she 's done when she was in office and the job that has yet to be complete . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
from our new york bureau as i was introducing a moment ago , dan fagen , the environment writer for news day and dan , whitman did consider herself sort of the republican environmentalist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but now there 's been an awful lot of monday night quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that she 's teped down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O 
what do you suppose took place here ? |||O O O O O O O O 
i think many people have watched thisstration in action and watched chis tee whitman in action . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the mystery is that she took the job in the first place or did n't leave earlier . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
she was quite a misfit for this administration , and she showed that over and over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she was not good at all at communicating the administration 's message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the epa bureaucracy , the epa environmental policy makers ' message to this administration because she saw herself undercut over and over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's interesting because leading into it , while she was new jersey governor , she sued the epa and she was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the epa and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let 's hear what she had to say last wednesday here on cnn just after announcing her resignation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i 'm not leaving because of clashes with the administration , in fact , i have n't had any . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i report to the president , and he has always asked me to give him my best unadulterated advice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have have been on the same page . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i was never supportive of protocol because it did n't do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm leaving now because it 's the appropriate time to do it . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
dan , do you agree with that ? |||O O O O O O O O 
she says the appropriate time . |||O O O O O O 
do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the administration ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm sure that it was difficult for her personally , but i think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if every day she did n't see herself being undermined and overruledded . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean if christy whitman and the white house were on the same page , i do n't think i 've seen a book large enough to contain a page that big . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
over and over there were many , many instances over the last |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
cnn_eng_20030526_133535.4 news story 2003-05 - 26 14:43:28 |||O O O O O O O 
let 's talk a little bit more about what the navy does to prevent such tragedies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'll try to explain it the best i can from what i remember from being on the " uss abraham lincoln " this is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the navy does with regard to prevention . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
everybody that is , every sailor that 's entersing the navy does take a swim test . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment , usually twice a day , they 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they also wear float coats . |||O O O O O O 
you can see them here . |||O O O O O O 
the yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they also have a manual device so if the toggles do n't work they can blow air into the inflation device . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have dive goggles and they 're able to find them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it also has a strobe light and a whistle . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
also such location devices , some ship have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to find or locate , let the rescuer locate them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
all throughout the ship , all around the ship . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not on entire all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now let 's talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you will hear a p.a . announcement around the entire ship . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a ship - wide search will happen f. they do n't see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
inside those helicopters rescue imswimmers . |||O O O O O O 
if indeed the man overboard is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's a number of reasons to look at . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
depending on the water temperature , it 's very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they 've exhausted all resources by that time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyway , we 'll continue to follow what 's happening on the " uss nassau " as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

night opens on the " uss john c. stennis . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
on this deployment they primarily fly after dark so the ship 's schedule is upside down , the crew sleeps by day and works all night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is day two of war time operations for the " stennis " and " operation iraqi freedom . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for the next 12 hours into the morning , planes from the carrier will fly missions over afghanistan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
there is only a faint orange light on deck , punctuated by this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to adjust their eyes for night vision , crew members make their way through passageways glowing in dim red light . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the flight deck , a walkover check for debris is lit only by flashlight . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the dangers of the flight deck being blown overboard by jets , slight sliced by propellers or other hazards that are hard enough to avoid in daylight are all the more intense at night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the intricate coordination of launch and recovery plays out as a dance in the darkness . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the complexity of it all has been described as a ballet and if it is a ballet , the choreographer of the flight deck is this man here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they 'll come back high fiving and feeling pretty good about it but it is a bit of a somber event that they 're going through out here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the biggest thing you 're seeing is the intensity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : the fighter jets dropped their ordnance in a coordinated atack on a convoy near the afghan city of choft . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
the pentagon says the convoy was taliban and al qaeda troops . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there was an attack on a convoy of leadership that was identified through various intelligence means . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that was done within the last 24 hours . |||O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : but the strikes prove controversial . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O 
local afghans in the convoy say it was a group of elders on their way to the inaugural ceremony for interim afghan leader hamid karzai . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
analysts believe some tribal warlords may have taken advantage of american firepower by accuse ing rife aal leaders of being taliban and misguiding u.s. intelligence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the consequence of injuring or hurting someone who is friendly or nonparticipant in combat is very difficult to deal with . |||O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a . and we go extreme details in -- and do a lot of training as well to make sure that does n't happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have dropped ordnance today . |||O O B-TRI O O O 
and i 'm sure we 'll continue to drop ordnance . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and do it with precision , do it with accuracy , and do it on call when needed first time every time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : as the " john c. stennis " ends it s first week of operations in the arabian sea , christmas is only a few days away . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
though a choir rehearses in the chapel for a christmas event , for the crew , it is another workday , their first day off wo n't be for another three weeks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is another day for me . |||O O O O O O O 
when i 'm out here , i do n't look at a calendar , i do n't think about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i stay busy at work . |||O O O O O O 
reporter : but there are other chances for the smip to gather like this moment of pride to honor sailors who earned a promotion in rank . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is called a frocking ceremony . |||O O O O O O O 
there is a sense of respect that you 'll agree as you walk around this crew is there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as they take care of one another the whole community comes together they follow together as a team or they win together as a team . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i always encourage them to take care of themselves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
because if they do n't care of themselves , then it kind of all falls apart at the seams . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : last time we saw this sailor he was washing dishes in the ghali . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they 'll be home in time for christmas . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i 've been here for four and a half years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is probably time to go . |||O O O O O O O 
but i 'm going miss them . |||O O O O O O O 
they 're pretty much my family right now , or my family away from my family . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : savoring every last minute on the ship , commander knight rushes to the flight only seconds before the door closes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
had is the best tour of my life . |||O O O O O O O O O 
19 years in the navy , it has been the best tour of my life . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a defense attorney calls it his worst nightmare . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a convicted murderer is released from prison before serving his full sentence and then a nightmare becomes reality . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
michael sears was determined to prove he was no longer a threat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
his psychiatrist backed him up . |||O O O O O O 
serious was serving a 30 - year sentence for the self - confessed 1992 killing of his wife in clinton , maryland , but after a relentless campaign that included a letter from his psychiatrist saying serious was unlikely to commit such violence again , the judge in this case , got him released . |||O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
he served less than nine years . |||O B-TRI O O O O O 
maryland is the only state that allows unchecked judicial reconsideration , allowing judges to reduce prison terms at any time after sentencing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
those favoring the rule say it gives convicts incentive to behave in prison and enables judges to release prisoners if new evidence comes to light . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
at some point after his release , michael serious befriended a woman named darlene williamson . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
last week williamson , a mother of four , was found stabbed to death at a condominium in greenbelt , maryland . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
the official resident of that condo , the man now charged with her murder , michael serious . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O 
today the judge in the case retired prince georges county circuit court judge issued a statement to the news media . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he called the case and i 'm quoting now , a judge 's worst nightmare , but he noted that maryland parole boards and the facility where michael serious was held , the institution made what the judge called the final decision on whether to release serious . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
the psychiatrist , by the way , who wrote a letter on michael serious ' behalf , neil blumberg had a two - word response in an article in the washington post. my goodness , he was pretty surprised . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
serious ' defense attorney who persuaded the judge reduce the sentence , told the post and i 'm quoting , i 'm very saddened . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

moving ahead now to a developing story , the hunt for so - called smoking gun , meant to prove that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here 's national security correspondent david ensor . |||O O O O O O O O 
reporter : while u.s. forces still have n't found any weapons of mass destruction , the new cia pentagon report says officials are now confident the mysterious trucks filled with high - tech equipment found in iraq are indeed mobile biological weapons production facilities , just as secretary of state powell predicted and presented the united nations before the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
it 's very important to recognize that programs that we had said existed do exist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : though no trace of biological toxin was found in the trucks , u.s. intelligence officials say they have largely eliminated any other possible use for the fermenters and other equipment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they could very well be biological weapons production facilities , but i do n't think the intelligence community has made an open and shut case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : the cia - pentagon reports admits the trucks were not an efficient way to produce biological weapons , but officials argue the point for the iraqis was to produce some and not to be caught doing it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this was clearly a very inefficient way to produce anthrax . |||O O O O O O O O O O O

five motions are being heard today in the case of lee boyd malvo , the teenage sniper suspect . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one for a change of venue . |||O O O O O O O 
defense attorneys argue that there has been so much pretrial publicity , including an alleged confession from malvo , that this has tainted the jury pool . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
their more intriguing argument is that one of the charges against malvo is under virginia 's anti-terrorism statute and they argue that every resident of fairfax county is potentially a member of the victim 's class . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and therefore , disqualified from serving as a juror . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the prosecutor will argue against this motion . |||O O O O O O O O 
he calls it factually pro pos truss . |||O O O O O O O O 
if history is any guide , this motion will have a tough time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no case has been moved out of fairfax county since 1974 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there also is a motion to dismiss this case . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
defense attorneys argue that an individual can not be charged under federal law and then state law for the same act . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
prosecutors again will argue against the motion . |||O O O O O O O O

that standing ovation that sammy sosa got at wrigley field last night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a major league baseball official is skilledded to conduct interviews in chicago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those interviews could be a factor as the league decides how sammy sosa will be punished for using a court -filled bat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our gary tuchman is live . |||O O O O O O 
reporter : the cub 's player this afternoon , once again , sammy sosa will be in the lineup but he could find out as early as today what his punishment will be and how many games he 'll be suspend for . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
last night when he went to play for the first time , most of the fans on wrigley field gave him a standing ovation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in all fairness , not all of them totally believed sammy sosa but he 's a hero here and they want to believe sammy sosa . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he hit the ground ball on the first inning , that scored a run , but the run was taken away . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sosa was quicked out of the game after he was found out he had a cork during the bat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he meant not to use it during the game , but he did use it during the game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
major league baseball took 76 of his bats and x - rayed them for cork . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those x race were negative . |||O O O O O O 
that was conducted by a trained radiological technician . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we believe the x- ray process was sufficient to determine the state of those bats and we 're very confident that all of those bats were clean and had no foreign substances within them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're all human and we all made a mistake . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
nobody 's perfect in this world upon . |||O O O O O O O O 
reporter : last night with the bat , we assumed was not cork , sammy sosa struck out the first three times up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he did hit a single in the ninety inning in a losing effort for the chicago cubs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's a concern with the huge series there this weekend with the yankees coming to town that sammy would be suspended during that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
the yankees vpts been to wrigley field since the 1930s since they played the cubs in the 1930s . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sosa could get a suspension , but he could appeal suspension . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so if he wanted to play against the yankees , he probably will be able to . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let 's bring jack back in with the question of the day and bill 's also joining us from d.c.. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

that 's the verdict after baseball officials x - rayed sam why sosa 's entire inventory of bat and found no evidence of cork or any other substance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that seems to support his contention that the bat got him ejected tuesday night was a fluke . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
still a decision on what , if any punishment he will face in the wake of that incident tuesday night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gary tuchman standing by in chicago , with the latest on the sosa saga outside of wrigley field . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : leon , hello to you . |||O O O O O O O O 
three hours from now the chicago cubs take the field against the tampa bay devil rays here at wrigley field and sammy sosa will be out there with them but how long will he ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we could find out today . |||O O O O O O 
his punishment , suspension for using a corked bat for use -- which is illegal during a game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
since the incident 33,000 fans in the stands for a night game he received a standing ovation from almost all of them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i heard a few boos but almost everyone standing . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
not everyone believing this man 's story , which is it was a mistake but he 's a hero here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these people want to believe his story . |||O O O O O O O O 
in the first inning he hit a ground ball . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
when he hit the ball , the bat broke . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the umpires found cork in the bat . |||O O O O O O O O 
it 's illegal because when you put it in the bat it makes the meat lighter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they hollow out the bat and stick the cork in there to mask the hollow sound . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then you can swing it lighter and you can swing it faster . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they took 76 of his bats for analysis . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the x - rays all came back negative . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but did major league baseball have all of sammy sosa 's bats ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are , as i said , confident , based on not only the presence of security in the club house but also the level of cooperation , the record keeping that we reviewed and so forth , that we have all of the bats . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i do n't want anyone to misconstrue what i said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is conceivable because we did n't have physical presence in the club house that we do not have them all but we are very confident that we do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm man enough to take everything that i 've done for . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i still walk yesterday like a man and take the blame . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the media today , they got it like i 'm a criminal and that 's something that really bothered me and hurt me as a man . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : now , why did sammy sosa have this corked bat ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , he says he has it because he uses it for batting practice to put on a show for the fans . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they asked him how many times he 's used it during batting practice and he says three or four times . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that raises the question does major league baseball have a rule about using corked bats during batting practice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

joe and myself , he 's the partner , we were looking to design some licenses to put on some t-shirts , and at the time big dogs were big , and all the mean dogs , and no fear was a big hit , and we thought it was time for a bit of a change for the 18 - 24 crowd . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

and we knew if he gave him some spunk , everybody would root for him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how did the taco bell folks run into you ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they actually came to us at a licensing show . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we had been licensing to a bunch of different manufacturers , and in 1996 we were at a show in new york city where nick loada and universal studios , and taco bell walked up to us and said they were looking for a mass cot for their brand and this would be perfect . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that started a year relationship we had with them . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and it went on for a year , and you thought it did n't pan out and then you pick up a trade paper and read they 're going ahead with it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after we finalized all the commercials , and actually done the campaign for them , they hired a new ad agency , and telephone calls just started staggering off . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then they stopped coming , and we ahead imp the ads , and they were exactly what we had presented for over a year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when you first heard that , or read that , did you just go ballistic ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , no offense , but it was you and one other guy who created this thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

reporter : for martha stewart seems business is everything . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
stewart has found the road to fortune wherever she has traveled . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think the temptation for any successful entrepreneur to go global . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : her marketing vision also included kmart a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
reporter : stewart is associated with kmart since 1987 and been very successful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the goal had been to bring affordable style to the masse |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's a reason she was successful . |||O O O O O O O O 
and the stuff that she 's created people like . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's attractive and it 's cheap . |||O O O O O O O O 
reporter : even as kmart struggled through financial difficulties , stewart stuck by the company . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's hard to run out on a partner that 's down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : now stewart is hoping people do n't run out on her . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the celebrity indicted on charges stemming from the sale of imclone stock . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
stewart and former imclone ceo sam waksal shared a broker who now also faces charges of obstruction of justice and perjury . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
her defense has been that she had a standing sell order at $ 60 and when the stock fell below 60 the broker supposed to , you know make the trade . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she 's been standing with that story . |||O O O O O O O O 
the broker standing by that story . |||O O O O O O O 
the only reason it 's not holding is because there are other people that the merrill lynch that investigated and did n't find proof that was actually the case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : after stewart was charged by federal authorities wednesday , her lawyers issued a statement in which they said , quote , martha stewart has done nothing wrong . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the accusation that martha stewart sold the imclone shares based on inside information proved to be false . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if she lied , then that is the obstruction of justice charge . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
that 's where the prison time comes in . |||O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : for stewart , the fallout from the past year taken a tremendous toll . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
martha stewart told me that the investigation itself had cost her about $ 400 million . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in decline in her stock , legal fees , and lost business opportunities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : ironic , considering the sale of the imclone stock resulted in a gain of less than $ 50,000 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , it 's almost like e.g. you get off the hook , but are you really off the hook because people always believe you were guilty . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and it 's hard to win back that sort of brand equity that she 's lost . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : stewart is vowing to clear her name of the charges . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
she is so focused and so determined that this investigation , while terribly upsetting , has not been something that 's stood in her way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as only she would , she said , look , i do n't lose any sleep . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i still sleep my three or four hours a night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : he says stewart is still taken aback by the reaction to her legal troubles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

reporter : with the success of a new television show and last year 's oz - fest tour ready to kick off , things were looking great for ozzy osbourne . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was rich and surrounded by a family who loved him but once again , ozzy 's high would hit a low . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that july , sharon osbourne , ozzy 's long time manager , wife and best friend , announced to the world that she 'd been diagnosed with colon cancer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
every fiber of ozzy was shaken . |||O O O O O O O 
he had to be sedated for a while . |||O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : sharon would have to undergo rounds of chemotherapy all summer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ozzy took time off from oz - fest to tend to his wife . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ever the rock , sharon faced cancer head on . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
when you go in there and people so much worse than me , and it 's like , how lucky am i have a great support system . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : even with sharon trying to make things as easy as possible on her husband , he was still a mess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
his struggle with sobriety would be tested again . |||O O O O O O O O O 
ozzy 's not doing too good right now . |||O O O O O O O O O 
drinking and he 's very delicate . |||O O O O O O O 
he 's , like , dealing with it the best he can . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : despite sharon 's illness , it 's business as usual for the family , though pushed back , filming commenced last fall on a second season of " the osbournes . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some days when i 'm feeling bad , i say i ca n't do this anymore , and then you wake up and see the crew , and then , you know , you snap out of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : the larger question loomed . |||O O O O O O O 
how could comedy come out of chemotherapy treatments ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
sharon is dealing with the diagnosis and illness but what 's interesting is humor is the same . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : and the humor did remain the same . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the show came back with a vengeance last fall chronicling ozzy and sharon dealing with cancer and the kids hoping -- coping with new - found celebrity and one of the top rated shows , ratings for the second season slid . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not banking my whole life on bringing , you know , number one rated show . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
having a nervous break down . |||O O O O O O 
reporter : this year , more ups and downs . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
sharon announced in april that the cancer was in remission . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but just weeks after that announcement , son jack entered drug and alcohol rehabilitation in california . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
his family said that his party life style caught up with him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , with a third season set to start , will ozzy 's role as a family man change the image in the annuls of heavy metal mad man ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think ozzy 's the guy that hit a head of a bat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
crazy , drug taking , hard drinking , hard living rock n roller . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think what the show does is also show that you might be those things , but also might be a pretty great dad , too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would n't be here now if it was n't for my wife . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i always loved my wife but sometimes i do n't like her and sometimes she does n't like me but we love each other . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i hate these people that go , we 've been married for 56 years and never had a bad word . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they must have been living in a different planet . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : ozzy osbourne 's life filled with incredible highs crashing into devastating lows . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a manic life , grounded in family values . |||O O O O O O O O O 
ozzy 's not going to like me saying this , but he 's a very tender , gentle man . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a guy whose world revolves not so much around music as around his wife . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
part of the legacy of ozzy osbourne is a cautionary tale . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's also , you know , tale that includes family love , you know , and a lot of good things . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : it 's a tale that continues to unfold . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
no telling how long the osbourne phenomenon may last but the family 's loyal following will always be screaming for more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : and so will ozzy . |||O O O O O O O

bringing you up to date on a breaking story out of the middle east . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in gaza , a pair of israeli gun ship attack , aerial attacks that have threatened to derail the road map to peace , as it is called . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the first attack , a car carrying rantissi , a senior member of the hamas group , a militant organization , was targeted . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
he survived , with wound , but two people were killed . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O

welcome back to " people in the news . " |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the intifada , the spontaneous 1987 palestinian uprising against the israeli occupation , heralded the rise of the muslim fundamentalism . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in what had been a mostly secular palestinian movement . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the most popular of these groups hamas , an acronym for islamic resistance movement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in english it means zeal , its aim -- the destruction of israel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hamas is an islamic movement . |||O O O O O O 
at the very beginning , it was encouraged by israel because they thought it was a counter weight to palestinian nationalism which is , of course , a secular movement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hamas was founded in 1988 by a blind paraplegic cleric who was influenced by the islamic muslim brotherhood , with backing from israel , he set up sharities in the improverished strip in the 1970s . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
slowly it became more and more politicized , and more and more extreme in its demands for an islamic state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the extremism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks . |||O O O O O O B-TRI B-TRI O O B-TRI O 
but hamas had already become an important part of palestinian society through its charity work and its influence increased over time by providing community services when the palestinian authority did not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hamas plays on the palestinian authority 's failure to produce . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it s basic message , the palestinian authority is corrupt , it fails to deliver , hamas is not corrupt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hamas cares about the person on the street and it does deliver . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
unfortunately , those same charitable organizations , those same charity committees that funnel the funds to needier palestinians , also serve to support terrorist attacks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
israel and the united states say arafat has not been tough enough on terrorism , and have attempted to force him out of the current peace process . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the prime minister known as abu mazen must now contend with the rejection of side by side palestinian and israeli states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a cornerstone of the new peace plan . |||O O O O O O O O 
he 's trying to get hamas to co - exist with israel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he is not working against hamas , he is working in tandem . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he is negotiating with them . |||O O O O O O 
he is not telling them to disband and regulate their weapons , so i have no faith in the ability of abu mazen to put terror aside . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
reporter : settlers call the just concluded israeli-american - palestinian summit a surrender , and were not impressed . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
the armed intifada must end and we must use and resort to peaceful means in our quest to end the occupation and the suffering of the palestinians , and the israelis , and to establish the palestinian state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hamas and other palestinian militant group rejected abbas ' call to end their attacks with a deadly raid on an israeli army outpost in gaza . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
we are all saying that the resistance will continue despite the summit in aqaba . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
israel retaliated on hamas , namely al - rantissi , it missed him and killed civilians . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
translator : hamas will not drop our weapons , even if all leaders are assassinated . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
reporter : since the second intifada began in 2000 , over 700 israelis have been killed , during the same time there have been more than 2,000 palestinian deaths according to the red crescent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
including hamas leaders targeted for assassination . |||O O O O O O O 
if you want an end to terrorism , if you want an end to violence , you have to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in the political process . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that hamas is ready to join the political process , however , if the only price for the political price is you must fight hamas , if that 's what they are requiring abu mazen to do , they are almost mandating that he will fail . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the main test of mahmoud abbas , will be to establish an overall command of all armed groups , if not , it does n't have a chance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

seven minutes before the top of the hour . |||O O O O O O O O O

those three men did n't realize how lucky they were until they were plucked out of the water . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have with us captain kent ringboard , on board the royal caribbean " radiance of the seas . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i understand you were on board when this rescue happened . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
yes , that 's correct i was in charge . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
tell us about what happened here . |||O O O O O O O 
what was it you were looking at when you looked out over the waters ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , it was quite windy , gusty winds up to 40 , 50 miles an hour . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and it came from southeast . |||O O O O O O 
and we got the alarm this distress situation just before 5:00 in the morning . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we were on relatively slow speed for the time being , but we of course , speeded up to the position , which was given , and we -- after an hour , we spotted the fishing boat in the waters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these men were in some water that was quite frigid . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
if they stayed out there for long they could have suffered severe tragedy , perhaps . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i want to ask you , have you ever done anything like this ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
have you ever seen anything like this done ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
no , i have never seen this type of operation where you have a fishing vessel disappear , more or less . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that the survivors , they had to go into the water , pick them up from the water . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
was there any point at which you did n't think you would be able to pull it off ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
was there any point at which you thought you would n't be able to pull it off ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we -- we were 100 % sure we could make it , absolutely . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because we came very close to the vessel . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we had our rescue boat out soon . |||O O O O O O O O 
so i felt confident about it . |||O O O O O O O 
i saw the fishermen also had the surviving suits on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
so that gave me more time to help . |||O O O O O O O O O 
that was a good thing for them . |||O O O O O O O O 
what about your crew that was actually involved in the rescue here ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are they trained for this sort of thing ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
yes , they are very much well - trained . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we train for this type of operation at least every 14 days . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm hopeful those three fishermen bought you a glass of wine once you got them on board . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not sure if you have been able to see some of these pictures playing on the television sets around the world but we look at these pictures and think there 's no way a cruise ship , as big as it is , will be able to maneuver into position in these kinds of heavy seas to save three corks out there on the water . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i kind of leaned over and gave her a kiss on the forehead and she looked up and -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they know little about their little girl , found by the side of the road days after she was born . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O

thank you for being with us . |||O O O O O O O 
thank you for having us . |||O O O O O O 
tell us a little about this journey , that moment when you first saw her . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is going on two years , you battled bureaucracy , traveling thousands of miles , facing disease . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , just to hold her in our arms , have her with us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , you count the moments . |||O O O O O O O O 
and it was just anticipation all the way there . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it was , you know , a dream come true . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
she was -- she 's really a delight . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , though it was a little pandemonium at the moment , she 's wonderful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , mark , it was -- the first time you were holding her , it looked like she was crying a lot . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she seemed startled to see someone that looked so different . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
yes , this was probably her first experience ever seeing a fair - skinned , bearded goatee , monster looking guy and she just freaked out the first time she saw me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it took about a day and a half for her to warm up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i had to hide in the hotel room . |||O O O O O O O O O 
she would find me in the room and start crying every time she saw me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you had to hide in the hotel room ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , she 'd find me across the room and break into tears . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was kind of that way with anyone that was blond , that was fair - skinned . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when you first heard about sars , i mean , did you suddenly think , this may not happen ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this could stop the whole thing |||O O O O O O 
we got calls that morning saying " did you hear that they 're halting all travel ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we put in a call to the agency . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and we put a lot of trust in our agency . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , unless we were absolutely stopped , we were going . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after two years of working towards it , we were almost more afraid not to go than to go at the very end . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , mark , i hope this is n't too personal a question . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if it is , just simply tell me to shut up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but when -- in the story i saw abby was abandoned on the side of the road , which is just -- it 's unthinkable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you ca n't even imagine a parent doing that . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
what do you think you 're going to tell her when she grows up about how she came to live with you ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i get emotional every time i -- someone asks that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but we 're going to give her the best love and affection we can and give her a strong self esteem and we 're going to teach her |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

well , sex abuse by priests remains an issue in the catholic church in the united states and it is certain to be an issue as bishops gather tomorrow in st . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
louis for their semiannual meeting . |||O O O O O O 
under a charter approved last year by the national conference of catholic bishops , diocese officials will report allegations of sexual abuse of a minor to public authorities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
past , present or future sexual abuse of a minor will lead to removal from the ministry . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O

a net worth of $ 300 million . |||O O O O O O O O 
anyone who knows me knows my obsession with tween stars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're kids eight to 14 , and for millions , their heroes are barely occupy puberty . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the reason for my obsession is simple , deep seething jealousy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is n't enough for these tween stars to be on the tv or movie . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they want to own every form of media and want to own it now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
unlike the corey feldman of the ' 80s , today 's tweens are n't content with succeeding in just one of medium . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mary indicate and ashley olsen started it all . |||O O O O O O O O O 
now they have a billion dollar empire built on videos , clothing perfume and more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then there 's the tween hilary duff , fans know her as lizzie mag wire . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
three corporate giants head the way . |||O O O O O O O 
typical , nickelodeon or disney starts them off . |||O O O O O O O O O 
then when they 're ready to breed they go to the wb. why such a focus on these tween stars ? |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it has little to do with their artistic vision . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
one star told vanity fair their favorite author is whoever wrote the bible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these kids are at that magical age when new multibillion declare spending power is put in service of intense peer pressure leading to brand loyalties that can last a lifetime . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the flip side between stars , though , is once the fans grow up their star power may dim . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do n't believe in just ask one of the coreys . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're right on the cover of vanity fair . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
tweens are all over it . |||O O O O O O 
that 's the issue right there . |||O O O O O O O 
so we have with us vanity fair fashion director elizabeth olsen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was shocked when i saw them covers the tweens . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
why are they so important ? |||O O O O O O 
they 're important because we report on what 's happening . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we report on the culture of what 's now , what maze money , what the buzz is , what 's next . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they 're making a lot of money . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a much more than a lot of money . |||O O O O O O O O O 
unlike stars of the past , they really are not content to be singers or dancers , they are like omnimedia , mini martha stewart . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're more than that , actually , because they have a television show to back themselves up , then the movie , then the clothing line . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have much more and reach a much broader audience as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i saw one interviewed , and they said , yeah , when i left the cosby show at age four , i cut an album at age five . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what happened happened to being kids ? |||O O O O O O O 
that was the great thing about the photo shoot . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
thee still young , ambitious , excited , they play dressup and have pillow fights . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would have i to say you have to talk about hilary duff , and you have to talk about the olsen twins . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because the olsen twins started it all . |||O O O O O O O O 
they more than started it . |||O O O O O O 
but they turned it into an empire , what shirley temple could have done . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think their company is called dual star , like a gross of a billion dollars last year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're not just sitting there hiring people to do their business . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
they do their own business , and they 're well - rounded and polite people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're so nice and cool . |||O O O O O O O 
they 're actually very , very cool . |||O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not sure of that . |||O O O O O O O 
and hilary duff is a star , and i guarantee you , they will grace their own cover . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do they all have staying power ? |||O O O O O O O 
one ca n't predict that all have it , but some have it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it depends on who 's managing it , what career choices they make , what their parents help them to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it would be interesting to see the audience that sort of adores them now , whether |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

senior israeli officials telling cnn that the size of the area to be returned to the gaza strip is not so much the question confirming that , in fact , returning all of the gaza strip to palestinian security control is one of the options the israelis have indeed put on the table , the issue is the palestinian readiness and willingness to be able to implement full security control throughout all of the gaza strip . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one of the big questions about mars is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
it 's an idea plagued with unsolved problems . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the latest issue of " popular science magazine " takes a look at the challenges nasa is facing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joining us is the contributing editor . |||O O O O O O O 
good to see you , jeff . |||O O O O O O O 
it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
so what 's the difficulty in being able to go to mars ? |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
it 's unimaginably difficult and different . |||O O O O O O O 
mars is at most times 100 million miles away from us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then if we stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
we 're talking about conditions where there 's radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the communications conditions once you 're on mars , just to talk to people on earth , there 's a 20 minute delay in the conversation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so the -- you know , the issues are so much larger than going to the moon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and for now , it 's 250 days , which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in space anyway . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but as you say , it 's a much further travel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but let 's talk about some of the hurdles that hamper humans to be able to survive there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the dust , for one thing . |||O O O O O O O 
let 's talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , first of all , the spacecraft would not be launched from earth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
you 'd have to launch is from in space already , which means we would have to build it in space . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so that means we need a good shuttle that 's going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth 's orbit all the way to mars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we have n't really developed yet , because we could n't carry that much fuel , obviously . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the bigger issue is once we get there , we ca n't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years , so we 're going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so we ca n't breathe there . |||O O O O O O O 
so we 're going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water , to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all of this is in the works now , but i think it 's going to take quite a few years to develop it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you talk about the cosmic radiation . |||O O O O O O O 
then of course there is the zero g bone loss , almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there could be as much as 50 % bone loss in astronauts in mars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
during the time in mars . |||O O O O O O 
because when the body has -- when there is no dpravity as there is on mars , the body does n't pick up the calcium in the bones , so it does n't keep getting the bones stronger and stronger . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so they will just lose it . |||O O O O O O O 
they will be almost like old people even at the age of 40 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thank you for joining us . |||O O O O O O 
looks like it will be some time before we make our way to mars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
but before we go , a look at what 's coming up next week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was in 30 states i think last year . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
on behal of republican candidates and i tend to do a lot of campaigning in the next year for the president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at some point , i 'm going to want to do it myself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
speaking of the presidency , you said it would be arrogant to talk about that office when it 's not under serious consideration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is that something that you 've ever given a glancing thought to ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

here 's jack back with that . |||O O O O O O O 
there 's a new poll out this morning , abc news washington post poll that suggests that most americans would support u.s. military action against iran in order to keep the country from acquiring nuclear weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
according to the survey , 56 % said they would back military force block iran from developing nuclear weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
38 % said they 'd oppose it . |||O O O O O O O O 
that was the question this morning . |||O O O O O O O 
would you support the use of military force to block iran from developing nuclear weapons ? |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
we have gotten hundred of responses beginning this one from edward in oklahoma . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it would be deadly to let iran let their hands on nuclear weapons employ i would support any action . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
karen brights , i do n't support iran . |||O O O O O O O O O 
why do we , america , get to choose who has nukes and who does n't ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is n't that the responsibility of the united nations ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
kay jones in waterford , connecticut , sure , let 's invade iran . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
wior already over there , besides the biggest cost us to next to the loss of life is transporting our troops overseas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O B-TRI O O O O

nuclear weapons in iran , hope -- and buzz writes no one wants to see a war , but no one upons to see another september 11th even more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
especially a nuclear september 11th . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O 
i would support military action in iran if it helps to stabilize that area of the world . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O

an occasion that marked the formal establishment between our two countries . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
since then this relationship has grown in importance to us both through good times and bad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
both of my generation and britain have special pause to remember the unacceptable sacrifice the russian people made to defeat fascism in the second world war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
nothing , not even the fact that our countries became estranged in the war 's aftermath , has ever dimmed our memory of the scale of your loss . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that experience should continue to inspire us , as we seek to build a more peaceful and secure world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when i visited your country in 1994 , i recall saying to president yeltsin that he and i spent most of our lives believing such a visit would never happen . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that i hoped he was as delighted as i was to be proved wrong . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm just as delighted now , nine years later , to be able to welcome you here and to learn about the great changes which have occurred in your country since i was there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
russia has established itself as our partner and our friend . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we work together bilatarily and on the international stage . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and we are developing new links all the time in fields of commerce , culture , counterterrorism , energy , education environment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know you will be seeing evidence of some of this during your visit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
president , it is , i believe , a sign of genuine friendship that we are able to have disagreements , but remain firm partners . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is no secret that the significant differences between our two countries earlier this year on how best to handle iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but we are now able to look forward together firmly in agreement on the route we have decided in the united nations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although , the tragic loss of british lives today reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but as we look ahead , we know that our long - term partnership is of profound importance to both of us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is clearly evident , if we look beyond the challenges of international politics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the last few months alone , we have heard the announcements of major investments in russia by british companies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have also heard a different sign of sir paul mccartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in red square . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we , in turn , have been enthralled by the celebrations of your own city in petersburg . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the same time , work continues to bring the young people of our countries closer together through language , teaching , school exchanges and university programs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have a vibrant and exciting relationship from which we both derive mass benefit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

comes with someone involved in case of a 22 - year - old disabled woman in florida . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they talk about her current predicament . |||O O O O O O O 
raped while in state care , pregnant . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O 
and forced in the spotlight when jeb bush tried to get a guardian appointed for her fetus . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
predicament goes hard enough to describe that . |||O O O O O O O O 
to continue a pregnancy that her lawyer says she is not aware of but the decision was n't based on the advice of the governor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reporter : we know her only by her initial , this mother to be , jds . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
only 22 years old with no known family . |||O O O O O O O O O 
police say she has the mental capacity a 1 - year - old . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
according to court filing , jds has cerebral palsy and she 's autistic . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she did n't become pregnant by choice , she was raped , police say in a group home overseen by the state of florida . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jds is now more than six months pregnant . |||O O O O O O O O O 
since she 's incapable of make her own decision , a florida judge based his decision on below to give birth on the recommendation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
two doctor agreed jds is , " in good health , " two sono grams reveal , no obvious or significant fetal abnormalities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although , jds is autistic , a guardian says jds appears to be responsive north just setting in a semiconscious state all the time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
still undecided , an appeal by governor jeb bush , who wants the guardian apointed for the fetus . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he says the unborn child must be protected . |||O O O O O O O O O 
however , a spokesman for the governor says he calls the court ruling for jds , not to abort the baby , compassionate and humane . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
last month in miami , a judge ordered an abortion for another severely disabled raped woman who had been living this a state - regulated home . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in that case , the young woman 's mother approved the abortion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and in this case , there are a lot of unanswered questions still . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for example , what will happen to the baby , and what will happen to jds ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course , according to the guardian , she 's very worried about that , too , and she has warned the court that she hopes the mother will be placed in a better home when all of this is over , one where she is far better protected than she was by the state in a home where police say she was raped . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
do they know who the rapist is ? |||O O O O O O O O 
that 's sort a yes or no , i suppose . |||O O O O O O O O O O O

give details about the people you suggest - their names , what they do now , and why you think they would do a good job as president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some names that have come up in the press are hillary clinton , colin powell , barak obama , arnold schwarzenegger and jeb bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what do you think of these candidates ? |||O O O O O O O O 
who would hate to see run for president in 2008 ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
hi , i 'm suzanne from philadelphia . |||O O O O O O O O 
sara hi , this is sara , from california . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
so who do you think should run ? |||O O O O O O O O 
sara uh -- i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O 
i was going to say , that 's quite the topic. |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have n't thought about it much . |||O O O O O O O O 
i know my husband said he thinks -- that uh -- colin powell should -- but i do n't think he will . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne i i do n't he think will either , because he turned it down in two thousand and four . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne sorry , two thousand and -- two thousand . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
two thousand , yeah , the one before that . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
sara yeah . uh -- i 'm not very fond of hillary clinton , so i -- i do n't think i 'd go for her , but -- but uh what do you think ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne um -- i am reluctant to see another bush brother on the ticket for the republicans |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne but i think that putting jeb bush would make h - -- the republican ticket easier to defeat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i really do n't think that hillary clinton -- would be -- a good choice for the democrats . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne um i do n't think barak obama would be a very good choice for the democrats . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just because he 's -- he 's really young , and he 's going to be starting off his career . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne um i would almost like to see john edwards on the ticket again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
did they ever do that one ? |||O O O O O O O 
that 's n - the - that 's happened before , has n't it , where someone who -- who was defeated ran again ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they do n't do it very often , probably just because they figure if he lost once , he 'll |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne well i i think he 's a really good candidate , and four more years could really help him develop his um -- could help him develop -- hi - his voting record especially . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i think that would help the democratic ticket a lot . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sara right , because that 's something he got -- kind of -- uh -- got brought up a lot . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , they -- let 's see . |||O O O O O O O O 
suzanne i mean , i 'd like to s - -- i 'd like to see the greens run david cobb again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
i have n't paid much attention to them , i -- i kind of looked at the -- the other listed candidates -- but i figure -- they d - -- they d - none of them had enough support to get close , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sara um -- trying to think who else -- arnold schwarzenegger |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think -- well he 's not qualified anyway , but |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne well , they might change something , you know , between now and then . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've heard people say that would take a -- i i do n't think they will . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh that takes a constitutional amendment . |||O O O O O O O 
that 's pretty hard to -- to get through . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i mean , you live in california . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
how is he doing -- in your state ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
oh , i think he 's done all right , um -- i i -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's a he 's a moderate republican , you know , he 's not |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sara he 's not uh -- hard core republican , so he works pretty well with -- since this is this is mostly a democratic state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 've been talking about getting the canadian - born governor of i think minnesota |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne to run as well . |||O O O O O O 
it 'd be the first woman running . |||O O O O O O O O 
have they never had a woman run before ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne well , geraldine ferraro -- well the first woman for a major party . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne as vice president -- for the democrats , i believe |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne um -- in the eighties . |||O O O O O O O 
but they 've never had a woman as a major candidate |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's got to happen at some point . |||O O O O O O O O O 
dole did n't make it too well . |||O O O O O O O O 
yeah , she was she was going to be the -- was she going to be the vice president |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suzanne i think she was g - actually going for president herself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she was actually going for president ? |||O O O O O O O 
suzanne i 'd like to see her come back . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
um i think she 's fantastic . |||O O O O O O O 
and she 's she 's not too hard - core republican . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this -- this uh -- last election being just over , i had n't really started thinking much about the next one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think any of the s - any other state governors have a really good chance ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , i i mean obviously , if schwarzenegger could run , he 's got the name recognition , but i would be really surprised -- both to see him run and to see him win , but then again -- i was a little bit surprised when he won california , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
who do you think should run for president / vice president in 2008 , and why ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O

what do you think of these candidates ? |||O O O O O O O O 
who would hate to see run for president in 2008 ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
a ah , but yeah , i do n't know who should run , i do n't think hillary can uh can make it , to be honest with you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she would be my s - -- well you know what , actually , i liked dean a lot i must say , in this election . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
and i think it was just |||O O O O O O 
b stupid how much flack he got . |||O O O O O O O O 
like i just -- i like the idea of bringing in somebody |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b with a -- fresh , with a different perspective , who was n't already just part of that whole political wheel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , because i think by the time they get to office , it really does n't really matter who is , you know , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , they 're still under the gun of the same big |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a corporate giants or whatever . |||O O O O O O 
well , that 's right , that 's right . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , so i do n't know i w - i was quite excited to have somebody that was coming from a really different perspective . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but that got shot out of the water . |||O O O O O O O O O 
b i i like hillary . |||O O O O O O 
i like her , she 's my senator , of course . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a but i do n't i do n't think she could make it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i think she 's a -- i mean she 's a strong woman , you know in terms of having |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b a a woman , potentially , as president , i mean , i think she 's the strongest |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b candidate we 've had in a long time . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
a do s - -- do some reading on the governors , of new mexico , or is it arizona , and particularly kansas , and the governor of north carolina . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do some reading on those three people , those are some people you should be really looking uh looking at , if y - if uh |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 're obviously a qu - -- a pretty politically savvy kind of guy , are n't you ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a well , i was the one , who just happened to go home back in like nineteen eighty or something and saw bill clinton |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he -- we ha - -- i came from a small town in tennessee called paris , and there 's two stations we can pick up , one |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a from jackson , a little town , and the other was from nashville , a big town . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so we got most of our ~ tv from jackson , so i was flipping through the channels , and i saw this little guy , uh the governor of arkansas giving a speech . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a i said , that guy could be president . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
a i only heard about -- two minutes of him speaking . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , he was articulate , he was charming , he was young . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i said , that guy could be president . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and um so then when i heard he was running , those four years later -- uh , eight years later , whatever it was . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because it was a long time later . |||O O O O O O O O 
a i saw him , and i was telling all my friends , oh , vote for vote for this guy , bill clinton , vote for him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they were saying , oh no , no , that old country -- dump . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i said , he 's a rhodes scholar , he 's smart . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's and he 's funny and he 's good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh no , no , he 's too young , and he came from that little , little podunk -- g - uh state he never did anything . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i said , he 's going to be president . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i was telling all my friends . |||O O O O O O O 
i said , you know , and i was before -- they said , well , i thought you supported george bush , and i said , well i did support george bush , but he does n't know what he 's doing and he needs to go . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
and uh so i says vote for him , vote for him , vote for him , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they voted for jerry brown and all these crazy people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a and i says , you 're just wasting your vote , why are you doing that ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i went and volunteered for him and everything , and -- and i met hillary , and and tipper and al , and and i almost got to meet him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i worked at the democrats convention and everything . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and uh it was great , i had a good time , and they |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , and they fed us , and had a party for us , all that kind of stuff , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i think we they better go back to a governor from like uh |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a uh north carolina , or like the one from kansas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she 's very tall , she reminds you of uh christie whitman , the governor of new jersey , remember her ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a she 's tall , kind of -- mm bush -- butch . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she 's uh you know , like she played basketball or something like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
real smart , quiet - spoked but stern , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , not not real feminine , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and so i -- she she can give that demeanor that people like in leaders , of being the big |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b well , people want to feel secure , right ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and who 's in that position ? |||O O O O O O O 
they want to feel that they 're trustworthy and honorable , and i think , you know |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b clinton did so many fantastic things during his term in office , but he shot himself on the foot with all of his personal garbage , you know , and i think that overshadowed how brilliant he was as president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
2 . workplace culture describe the organizational structure of your current or former workplace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O

and that 's pretty much it . |||O O O O O O O 
i mean , we go over whatever -- whatever has to be -- talked about that day , and then they 're all we just kind of -- go out and do our appointments in the afternoon , or in the evenings . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O

they -- have a interest in home improvements , and they fill out stuff . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

jim ( ( ) ) -- yeah , i 'm from morgantown . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

jim south southwest of you . |||O O O O O O

we only have , we only have one point eight million people in our whole state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i started there , and we only had -- it was only like maybe thirty kids that that came to the -- to the uh community center . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but now we got seventy - eight . |||O O O O O O O O

suzanne that you 've got a heart and you care that much about children because i mean there 's a lot of them , i 'm sure , that need -- that need the assistance , or the counseling . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah i i if it and eh -- i know i love the kids because the pay is not all of that good , so -- you know , but i manage . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we take them out on a lot of field trips and things like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
every wednesday , we go down to the uh river bank park . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
and you know , they got swimming , indoor swimming , and everything . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's so sweet of you though . |||O O O O O O O O 
we we we 're um trying to run a uh we 're selling these uh -- excuse me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so we could raise raise money , so we could take them to great adventure . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
suzanne yeah , yeah , do y'all have a website or anything ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but in fact , you know , we do it on the streets , you know , right in front of the the in front of the community center . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we just stand out there and sell cookies . |||O O O O O O O O O 
or we 'll do a car wash thing , you know , have it -- rewarded . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fire hydrant and stuff . |||O O O O O O 
or we wash people cars for a dollar or two . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
just to raise some money . |||O O O O O O 
2 . workplace culture describe the organizational structure of your current or former workplace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how many people work there , and what is the hierarchy ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what kind of job do you have ? |||O O O O O O O O 
describe some of the people that you work with and the jobs they do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think your company is well - run ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
if not , what could make it better ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
and then we 're not supposed to answer it . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well , um all i can say about big corporations -- is there 's too many -- chiefs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b always too many chiefs . |||O O O O O O 
and with the constant merging with other banks , |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
or well , and then you think of things like enron . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a i mean , you got -- corrupted chiefs too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the uh ~ ceo we had before we merged with nations bank -- he uh -- he about ran as into the ground with some hedge funds that he had gone into . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then , and then when we finish merging , they give the guy something like a twenty - five million dollar package , and if he dies , his family still gets all the money . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they would n't do anything like that for me . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've been there for a long time , i used to be a manager there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's no way i 'd get that kind of a -- oh . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , yeah , once you get way up there , unless you 're prosecuted , you you just -- are constantly rolling in the dough . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that was a long time ago , and we just c - oh , all that money , for just about bankrupting us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
i think that was in ninety seven or eight |||O O O O O O O O O 
i think we merged in ninety - eight . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so , yeah , bank of america 's everywhere . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and um -- mm -- gosh i ca n't think of anything else to say about them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah i i 'm not really familiar with the working world that much . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , i mean , with my part - time job , it 's a lot it 's really good for a student , because i only work uh two hours a night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a so , yeah , and then it 's pretty flexible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
like uh -- uh i 'm pretty busy with other , you know -- student organizations , and hanging out with friends and stuff , so i do n't have to work on the weekends , and then i can take off sometimes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so a pretty good deal , and the cool thing about is like -- everybody at work is really friendly , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a and uh i think really that what brings that on is our boss . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
like he 's just a really nice guy , and -- he 's pretty laid back . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
got to have a good boss . |||O O O O O O O 
i do n't know if there 's any pudding in the refrigerator honey . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you got to go -- i i think you ate it all , but go look around -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know there 's still some more um trix yogurt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i 'll buy pudding on friday . |||O O O O O O O O 
he 's all upset with me cause there 's no pudding . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i 've had many many different kinds of managers , and when they 're laid back do n't micro - manage -- you know , you definitely , work harder for them , and do a better job and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
did you ever see the uh movie office space ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it took me a second , but i sure did . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i always think about that like -- or a lot of i think college students think about that like with some office jobs , you know ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's kind of like , that 's the job that they 're t - everyone 's trying to stay away from . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think they 're quite -- they they 've gotten better . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know the bigger companies have tried to -- stay away from that , cause uh -- the the that does wear you out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i remember bank of america was -- kind of like that in the department i used to work in , years and years ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
boring looking walls , boring people , boring job . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it it drained the life out of you whenever we had to go to work . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but they tried to make it more entertaining . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i think more companies are going for the uh -- you know , employee satisfaction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b th - that was the bank 's big deal last year , was uh ninety percent associate satisfaction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they were all happy when they finally got there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but we did n't get anything for it . |||O O O O O O O O O 
they did n't like give everybody bonuses or anything . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they because they got some better insurance policies and some better -- bonuses that they paid out at the end of the month and -- you know , it was a little better . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , well , you got to make your employees happy , otherwise you 're not going to come out with the next product . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're not going to work so hard for ya . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're going to call out sick |||O O O O O O O 
b they 're going to do -- you know , half - assed job . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's exactly the way it is . |||O O O O O O O O 
mikey hold on , i 'll be off the phone in a minute . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i also , i worked for uh , like kind of like a subway , uh atlanta bread company . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a so , and man , oh this is for a summer job , and my boss was like -- well he was also the owner |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
2 . workplace culture describe the organizational structure of your current or former workplace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how many people work there , and what is the hierarchy ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what kind of job do you have ? |||O O O O O O O O 
describe some of the people that you work with and the jobs they do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think your company is well - run ? |||O O O O O O O O O O

alexander hi , this is alexander from minnesota . |||O O O O O O O O O 
bill yeah , i 'm bill from , uh , tampa , florida . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alexander hey , g - interesting topic . |||O O O O O O O O 
alexander eh , what kind of job do you do , sir ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what does the work at your place ? |||O O O O O O O O 
bill well , actually , i 'm self employed . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and i , uh , what i do is i -- whole sale -- cars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , i i really do n't have any workers , i just -- work by myself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , i guess -- i just have one that helps me once in a while to pick up cars and -- deliver them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , uh , that 's uh -- interesting that they called me on that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so you guys -- but what kind of culture do you have if you work two people work , that should be some sort of every place has |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alexander the atmosphere of , you know , how things are done , who 's in command and how , you know , decisions are made , and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they also did say that , uh , previous work places , too , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
okay , wh - uh i i |||O O O O O O O 
bill i can talk about that . |||O O O O O O O 
alexander go a - go ahead , you can talk about your previous work place . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bill yeah , wh - -- yeah , i was going to ask you where you work , too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alexander i work with a pharmaceutical company . |||O O O O O O O O 
i we -- have a little over three hundred and some ( ( million ) ) employees . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and what do you do there ? |||O O O O O O O 
i work as a patient care advocate . |||O O O O O O O O 
and i -- i work as an onli - |||O O O O O O O O O 
i do online , you know , online , uh , pharmaceutical company -- where i have -- filled and -- refilled take orders sent back to us online . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , you know , and i have a company , as well , set up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think we have the account manager , and we have -- the vice president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have super - team lead - team leads , uh i and then have operations specialist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have , you know , i -- team managers , training managers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a very big company . |||O O O O O O O 
yeah , and i think that the atmosphere is very good , i |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bill well , i think that 's important to to have a good atmosphere and also , uh , uh , i - know who who really is in charge , uh , you know , and and know who you have to answer to . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i years ago i had a company that was , uh , it was , uh , i was a subs - s - captive sub-contractor for making packaging material . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , um , there were a lot of salesmen in the company , they had a tendency to , you know , there was there was , uh , a chain of command , you might say . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , there was , uh , the person that was the , uh , head of the organization . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , all the salesmen -- used to come around and give orders , too , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it made it kind of difficult for the m - for my employees , because they would the salesmen would be coming out , uh , uh , without consulting with the one that was in charge . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they would just be coming out and giving orders when they should already went through him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it made it difficult . |||O O O O O O 
so i i i think it 's really important to h - have that really clear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that that there 's some organized way to deal with , uh , problems and orders and things like that , and if there is a problem , then -- you go to the person who 's in charge and -- then they can handle it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , that was -- that that 's just a you know , a -- previous , uh , type of work that i had . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i and tha - i think that 's what they wanted us to talk about , too , right ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , that 's that 's that 's i think it 's just basically , is ( ( ) ) one of the things i perceive is if - what kind of , you know , environment is it , and is it inviting is it , you know , all that they i guess that 's what they 're aiming at . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , it 's not a place where everybody trying to give instruction and everybody trying to do , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , but i for my job is i - i - -- we have us a very diverse feel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have a lot of people who are from different country , and , you know , and -- i think they are pretty much accepting , and i , you know , i - bas - basically you - you can promote yourself if you do a good job , i mean , they do n't pick and choose , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a very -- environment that allows you to grow in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i think they thinks |||O O O O O 
i rightfully do n't , if -- like if i have a problem , like , i 'll freshly go to my team lead or the supervisor and she takes it to her boss , and , you know , the boss takes it to the next level and , you know , something like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , but that -- i feel like that that 's very important . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , for a company to be well - run , it has to have , uh , a c - it 's t - has to be able to send a clear message -- as to how to handle problems and who who is the one that 's uh , uh , indicated for -- for those problems -- to handle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and and people -- those in the company need to be um instructed -- to know wh - where their relative place is in the company . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so that they they do n't overstep their bounds . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
bill because when that happens , and it that makes , uh , that creates problems for the employees . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , if they if they can be , eh , um , you know , jumped on arbitrarily by just about anybody , then pretty soon , you know , they 're they 're they 're not going to be content at all , they 're just going to wonder , well when when 's the next hit going to come , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when 's somebody else going to jump on me ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
2 . workplace culture describe the organizational structure of your current or former workplace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how many people work there , and what is the hierarchy ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what kind of job do you have ? |||O O O O O O O O 
describe some of the people that you work with and the jobs they do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think your company is well - run ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
if not , what could make it better ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
diane i 'm from lufkin , texas . |||O O O O O O O O 
oh , tell me about your workplace . |||O O O O O O O O 
roger i was going to say , you go first . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
diane okay , it does n't matter . |||O O O O O O O O 
you can or i can . |||O O O O O O 
um -- predominantly hispanics work in the kitchen area . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're uh -- well , actually , you know they 're some of my cake decorators in the bakery area too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're it 's it 's predominantly a hispanic run organization . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not hispanic , but they uh i 've hired uh |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
diane a couple that worked out quite well , and then i 've let them -- recommend family members and friends , and that seems to have been a really -- good setup , because they 're -- recommending people that they know work well , and -- you know , it 's it 's uh and they 're happy with who they 're working with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i 've sort of left some of that up to them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've got a a manager that -- you know , she 's -- i defer to her on who thinks whether she thinks i should hire somebody or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
and i 've had really good luck , because the restaurant business typically um |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
diane does not keep people very long . |||O O O O O O O O 
it 's a short term employment , and i 've got people that 's been with me for eight , nine , ten years now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , long term employees , so |||O O O O O O O O 
diane it 's -- it 's been a good setup . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
um -- you know , i 've got the older ones typically are the ones that run the different departments , you know the the -- deli area or the bakery area or the up front area , and -- the new ones kind of defer to them , and -- it sort of runs itself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've got a i 've got a really good crew . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
diane i think i 've got a working situation . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
hey , tell me about yours . |||O O O O O O O 
so you got -- you at the top , but you got a manager , huh ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've got a girl that i 've hired uh well , i hired her , let 's see , about nine years ago -- it 's a hispanic girl but she speaks fluent english and spanish , so she can work with both -- you know either language problem . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and she 's uh -- hard worker , always there , um -- everybody -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she works with everybody rather than just telling them what to do , and they respect her and work for her quite well , so -- i 'm not working nearly as hard as i was a few years back . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tell me about yours now . |||O O O O O O 
roger okay , i um , work at a moving company , classic design services , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roger and -- i am a driver -- and a loader and -- a lot of other stuff . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um i work for -- this guy named uh joe , he was a regional -- bank manager for wachovia for a few years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and bought our company out from our previous owner . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
do y'all do cross country ? |||O O O O O O 
roger i 'm kind of like -- huh ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
do y'all do cross country moves , or just local ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
roger yeah , we do , um -- we have a uh -- a office in phoenix , arizona , and we do uh basically do continental ~ usa |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roger um moves and -- pickups and deliveries -- from all over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i work mostly in the local department and sometimes -- i um in -- you know , sometimes i get on the road and -- travel , but -- not not t - not too often . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's about , there 's over a hundred and twenty now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ooh , big big company then . |||O O O O O O O 
roger ( ( ) ) -- i used to know everybody . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and uh now it 's -- now i do n't know everybody , so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it started off , when i first got there four years ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there was like , about -- thirty forty some people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it kind of doubled , but uh -- um business has been coming in , uh -- you know , we stop having slow seasons , and now it seems like it 's always busy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
3 . bush cabinet president bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like colin powell and john ashcroft resign . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
if you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ? |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
what new cabinet positions would you create and who would fill them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a i i 'm sorry to see colin powell leave , leaving . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i think he 's probably one of the most -- diplomatic -- um , men that i 've seen in politics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he he 's very honest , he 's very strong in his beliefs , and i 'm sorry to see him go . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i 'm also sorry to see tom ridge resigning . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i am too , and you know what , i do n't where , do you know anything about his background ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know where he came from . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a he 's the governor of , he was the governor of pennsylvania . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a and um after uh |||O O O O O 
a he before nine eleven , he was -- he was on an advisory committal -- committee -- to the gover - to the president i guess , besides him running uh pennsylvania , and then after nine eleven they appointed him you know , head of homeland security , and then created the |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a uh secretary 's position for him , or for someone , but him being the person at that time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a it 's so soon -- since nine eleven , and he has been creating his own job , i - in essence , because it 's such a new position . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , i think it 's -- it would 've been -- better to have one person -- like continuing that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i hate to i hate to change -- change horses there so quickly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh i i i 'd that -- that -- job uh uh needs continuity -- for a while . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , i m - i mean , at least until they get |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b settled on what the job really is . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , well uh maybe maybe on one hand -- somebody new will bring a new perspective to it , which would -- be helpful , but i still think that |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a the people that are up for it -- there 's some p - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , but if it 's if the perspective is too new , you know , that 's not going to be a good thing , because uh wholesale changes is not what they need to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh uh no matter who takes it over . |||O O O O O O O O O 
they need to they need to -- think long and hard before they start making changes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because if they make one wrong one , you know , it |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a but there are there are a couple women up for -- the position as well as um you know , a few men that are up for the position . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i do n't know anything about the women that are up for the position . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um -- one -- two of the men are from new york , one is a head of -- the the -- who was there at nine eleven . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O 
he was the chief of police . |||O O O O O O O 
or the commissioner -- of of police i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
uh who was with giuliani throughout the whole thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
um they 're also thinking about giuliani , so -- i mean , i think they have some qualified candidates . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a however , i think -- with it 's homeland security , which means it ca n't just be new york , which is where of course , their focus is going to be . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a having -- you know , been there , and through that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , as long as they do n't have blinders on , you know , i would be okay with that , but they 've got to look , obviously -- at ports -- nuclear power plants , you know , and oth - other areas where we are vulnerable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , and you know what 's really scary to me ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i i do n't i 've never seen it mentioned , i 've never -- but -- but if they really wanted to to i do n't know uh uh uh if they if they really wanted to put -- fear in the american people , uh -- i know it would work with me , is if they say just uh if if -- i say they , bin laden , or who whoever -- uh -- uh is running that team now , uh were to -- were to just pick a small -- mid - american town , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b uh and just wipe it out , |||O O O O B-TRI O O O 
a yeah , no , and i i thi - i think that 's a great fear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b you know , and there are a lot of ways -- there are a lot of ways to do that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , i mean , it would n't take a nuclear weapon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b uh uh and it it could be done so easily because i - i - most small towns are protected by a small town police force . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a well , i think that -- there 's -- really -- been a strengthening , and i hope they can -- get it together without this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
part of the problem with that is the ~ cia and the ~ fbi and who 's going to be in charge because they want to create this new position . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a and , so nobody wants to -- give up -- power |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a and , you know , you -- in this case , and and going forward , we have to put the good of -- the country -- and the good of the world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush cabinet president bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like colin powell and john ashcroft resign . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
if you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ? |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
what new cabinet positions would you create and who would fill them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh hi ron . i 'm uh sherri and i live in indiana . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri yeah , not too g - -- we 're neighbors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's sort of unusual in these calls , in my experience so far . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
let 's see , my first call i got was from russia . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
oh , i have n't has any outside of the ~ us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri eh uh i just that was just that one , my very first one was from russia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh , i would love to get . |||O O O O O O O O 
and it was moscow , r - the russia , not moscow , indiana ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh , definitely , it was it was moscow , russia , with a real russian accent , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ron i mean ah iowa , i mean . |||O O O O O O O O O 
sherri yeah i i did n't know it was international . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i thought it was just you know the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , jeez , that 'll be something to look forward to . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i i 'd love to get someone from outside the ~ us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so uh what do you think about the uh topic of discussion this evening ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri i 've been sort of surprised . |||O O O O O O O O 
eh uh i -- i heard uh that colin powell wanted um -- to resign last year and they talked him out of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
or something like that and uh so -- i was still surprised this year when |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh thi - you were surprised that he yo - that he decided to step down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O 
sherri yeah i i i still was uh -- kind of surprised . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and uh -- and then uh with condoleezza rice . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're appointing her ta - to a new position , and i was surprised about ashcroft . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri i was n't like it and then tom ridge yesterday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ron yeah , i saw that . |||O O O O O O O 
yeah , i i uh that one i think one probably was the one that most surprised me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i had n't i had n't really thought about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
ashcroft surprised me a little bit um but um i sort of started to think he might step down because evidently he was being he was considered somewhat of a lightning rod for um you know some of his more controversial stands and stuff so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but and and so have you been following the uh the proposed nominees ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean do you think |||O O O O O 
sherri kellogg , the kellogg guy . |||O O O O O O O 
where 's he going to commerce ? |||O O O B-TRI O O O 
is that where he 's headed ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O 
sherri yeah , that 's it , huh ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
ron yeah , i do n't know anything about him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you know anything about him ? |||O O O O O O O 
sherri mm. well , all i know is that that 's like a real prestigious uh position , you know to be the what the ~ ceo of kellogg ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i guess it sort of concerns me that uh you know we 're looking at yet uh another corporate head coming into the government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri mm. ye - ye - you know , this is like a -- uh it 's a re - -- i think we have a real problem . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is uh -- you know almost like a big beast you know that 's right there and we do n't even identify it |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri way way way more than we realize . |||O O O O O O O O O 
ron yeah , i i think you 're probably right and i think it -- maybe even particularly true under this president , although i do n't think it 's just limited to him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think it 's a common problem in the ~ us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri i f - -- i uh i think i - i - it 's uh more evident now than ever . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , really um -- tremen - tremendously a ruling and reigning . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri i think it it 's a global uh has a global effect . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that 's why al - qaeda -- took down the the uh twin towers . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O 
eh w - they were making a a statement . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
uh i think something like that possibly , that it had to do with corporate america . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh - huh , you mean about the corporate thing ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh you mean because of its -- what it represented around corporate america or something ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is that what you think . |||O O O O O O 
i think what corporate america represents -- you know the the financial scheme of it all , the |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri the it just how it eff - effects the globe , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri and how eh it effects third world countries and you know just the whole thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri it 's a you know like a a a wealthy despotism or something like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so any thoughts on who you uh you would name ? |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
you know who i would name ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O 
i know this is really wild . |||O O O O O O O 
but uh i do n't know you 'll probably really laugh but i do n't know , i i i always thought that -- ralph nader was kind of a a character |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri but what i really i mean i really listened to what he said when he was being interviewed |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri and in just a few words , he did n't mince any meat or anything , in a few words he said so much that was so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri like -- like a clarion call it rang so clear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you could hear what he was saying and it was really making sense , and i think he 's an expert |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so who would y - what would you appoint him to ? |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i mean , i think that 's a good idea . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri eh -- there 's something to do with the economy y - you know for the with the to deal with the |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sherri just uh -- like a an equa - e - economic equilibrium or something . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he might be be good at -- yeah , he might be good at commerce instead of that kellogg 's guy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush cabinet president bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like colin powell and john ashcroft resign . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
if you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ? |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
what new cabinet positions would you create and who would fill them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and the one that , oh what 's the -- the guy that , um -- tom ridge just re - resigned yesterday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
he was another one that was -- i did n't really know that much about him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , i guess he was kind of the first -- one on that homeland security or , in charge of that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i heard that they were going to -- one of the possible candidates is the the guy he used to be the chief of police of new york . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O 
well that 's somebody to me that 's going to have some good -- insight into , you know , what it takes you know -- to -- keep a city secure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , because new york , i do n't know if you 've ever been there |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , i went there ( ( before ) ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
a has has has got some -- different rules from texas as far as -- you know you know , running the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean i , there 's a lot lot more people dense population up there than there is in in texas and they probably would have uh the pol - uh the police chief would probably know -- well what can work in like , airports or , you know , things , situations like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was , he was a pretty good -- pretty smart person . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i , it did n't -- i ca n't remember his name , but -- the , i saw an interview with him , and -- how he , uh -- ran new york and uh -- you know , some of the -- ru - you know , they changed some of the rules , uh -- uh , not rules , but the way they -- uh |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the the police kind of changed their tactics and , because there was a lot of -- oh -- run down areas , and a lot of crime and they , you know -- got -- cleaned it up , and and -- they passed some laws that said , you know , you could n't , i think it was like , um -- you know , like homeless people that -- carrying -- uh -- you know , shopping carts , or something like that , and it sounds -- small -- to outlaw that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but they outlawed that because they said a lot of people were stealing stuff . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 'd stick them in the shopping carts and push them down the road . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you would n't know , oh , they 're just a homeless person . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well they cut that out and they found out -- it cut down on the theft . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh -- i guess people -- hide them in their basket and -- or taking something and then stick in their basket and the police never -- you know , bothered them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , the homeless people -- i guess , they need their shopping cart , so they kind of went elsewhere , so -- um -- i mean it 's a small thing , but it was , they just figured out , they were -- you know , uh -- learning from experience on what they need to do in the -- city and -- i think he would be a good -- candidate for the homeland security , running that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , eh , for the foreign po - uh this is all all what you are saying is like , about the internal -- but what about the external policy or something like that ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
whom do you think would be suitable ? |||O O O O O O O O 
b like , eh , foreign po - or international policy or external or |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b uh , whom do you think -- would be suitable for this position ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a to run foreign policy ? |||O O O O O O 
um -- like , uh -- well , it was -- colin powell was secretary , was he secretary of state ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
is that what that was ? |||O O O O O O 
a and condoleezza rice is going to step into that position , the way i understand it , uh . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , she may be -- uh uh uh , you know , uh -- a uh bush yes person , you know , i do n't know , uh |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , so i i do n't think this will change too much i mean . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a well mo - most -- most -- aides to the president , if it was -- you know , i guess when it was clinton it was , they 'd probably be kind of yes people too , but , i mean they pick the person to -- you know , help them and i guess they 're going to have to have -- philosophies and and -- run it the way they would or way they 'd want , uh |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , actually i agree with you . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i think uh -- during , uh , clinton time uh -- the uh like international policy or the external policy was -- was much better than -- uh what what is happening right now , so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think if we took bill clin - bill clinton as like , as a foreign policy -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he he would be he will do a very good job . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , do you think there is uh -- some other , uh like -- positions has to be has been -- has to be created , like uh -- for the next election . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
a i 'm s - -- say that again . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , i mean , is there any other , eh , positions or -- uh , like uh , has to be created like the -- uh -- election . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean -- uh , for example they they made , uh -- a position for like , uh -- internal eh , security -- i i think after , eh september eleventh |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b they created a position like that . |||O O O O O O O O 
do you think there is -- some other position has eh have to be created ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a i do n't think so . |||O O O O O O O 
i do n't think you need -- uh -- you never know what 's go - going to happen , i mean um -- what could -- you know , there could be something hap - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
3 . bush cabinet president bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like colin powell and john ashcroft resign . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
if you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ? |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
what new cabinet positions would you create and who would fill them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a um -- and then i i do n't -- know who would you who else would you -- well what about ruly -- rudolph giuliani |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think -- i think rudy giuliani was a great mayor -- for nine eleven . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O 
i do n't think he was a great mayor the whole time he was a mayor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a well , i i 'm a new yorker , and i got to tell you that i i think nine eleven i i think -- basically made him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O 
other than that , i think he was a little too decisive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a uh not i should n't say decisive , too divisive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a as far as -- the race relationship in this city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , it does n't take much to to please -- the other side . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that and that 's what government is all about . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
a and he -- he was n't -- he was n't too much of a good uh |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he he would 've gone out as a mediocre mayor had it not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i but even even saying that i ca n't begrudge him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but he did a great job in the crisis . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
some people do better in crises . |||O O O O O O O 
exactly , exactly , i i think that nine eleven made him and |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
a and at that point in time , he wanted to stay on , which was sort of sort of ridiculous . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and if if if i do n't think the rest of the country knows that , because they do n't know what he did before nine eleven , because they do n't pay any attention . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
exactly , of course , you 're right , you 're quite right . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that if he did get a government agency , it would have to be one that was having crisis a lot of times i mean , he would just have to devote himself to that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if he could just do that , it would be fine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but if he gets if gets into a lot of policy making and stuff that for other things , you know , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i i i i know i one of the |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
probably would be a good attorney general , he did that |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
a it could very well , he did a good job , you 're right , he probably could follow in what 's his name 's footsteps . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think i think the cases that he picks and chooses probably i would n't necessarily put on top of the list , but he did seem to |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that much i think we can we can probably agree with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he will probably do that evenly . |||O O O O O O O 
a i you know who i thought would have made a great , uh well i i know you guys had your own political uh struggles in jersey . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a oh it certainly was , i i saw the footage . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b right , right , all of a sudden . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
within one day , everybody i met said -- oh , mcgreevey , sure , i knew that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that became the national thing to say in jersey , and in jersey . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
like , everybody knew it , i 'd be like , you did not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah i think i was -- i think i was -- i was on a cruise , and i put on the television uh when i got in at the six oh clock news , and bingo , there he is , uh resigning as governor of uh new jersey . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
i said , you 've got to be kidding me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
a but uh -- i thought he would have made a name for himself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i i ca n't think of anyone anyone that anyone else out there that um -- that warrants . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , you know , you just |||O O O O O O O O 
a pick people who i think will uh -- have the experience in government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well not in , not in government , but in the private sector . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um -- who are responsible , and um -- put them in a position to lead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , yeah , i think uh -- apparently -- the president likes people that are the same philo - -- political philosophy as him , and i 'm not sure i mean i think he just needs some other voices in there , but |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know if it 'll happen . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a that 's a good point . |||O O O O O O O 
he he needs some liberals in there and he needs some -- ralph nader people , and some green party people , and some , just some . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a well i i think more conservative , what do you call them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
conservative uh -- um -- um what do you call them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh conservative uh -- more -- oh bloody he - |||O O O O O O O O O O 
a i yeah well i guess you could look at it that way , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a um . um . i did n't particularly like the the tone about the the religious uh -- side of -- the that election . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i i thought that was a little crazy . |||O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i think pretty wack . |||O O O O O O O 
a if it 's one thing we need to be careful about , it 's separating the church from |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b exactly , i 'm a pastor , and that bothers me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a and -- uh -- yeah . |||O O O O O O O 
oh i i 'm glad to hear some uh an actual pastor who says that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i i i think that we need to make sure that that that |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a that stays the way it is . |||O O O O O O O O 
i think it serves everyone well . |||O O O O O O O 
well , for one thing , it it ends up as the uh -- government officials are those seeking office , and uh -- preaching and teaching to people , and that 's my job . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you mind your stuff , i 'll tell my people what we 're doing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
peterson trial scott peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife laci and their unborn son , and he now faces the death penalty . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think he is guilty of the crimes he 's been convicted of ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if so , what were his motives ? |||O O O O O O O O 
how closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what kind of sentencing should peterson receive ? |||O O O O O O O O 
christina i 'm christina from connecticut . |||O O O O O O O 
i 'm greg from columbus , ohio . |||O O O O O O O O 
i was like , i got to talk to someone about this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have to voice my opinion . |||O O O O O O O 
well , no , i mean you could go or , well |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
greg uh , i -- okay , go ahead . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
hey shoot , you got more sense than i do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
christina okay , i -- have been following the trial , i do n't know why , ever since this whole thing happened . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i am a stay at home mom , so i get to watch the ~ tv more often , and i -- you know have been fo - -- watching all these forensic pathologists , dr. henry lee . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , and and what i see is that there is no physical evidence that he did it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and yeah , it sounds like he did do it because he dyed his hair , was trying to get away , and the anchor and a boat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but there 's -- -- i for some reason , deep down in my heart , do n't believe he did it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and you know and i think the media made him guilty , and i think -- it 's like you know , i mean you saw what happened outside the courtroom , i do n't know if you did or not , see how they were cheering on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think he 's guilty and , i hope he does n't get the death penalty . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
and -- i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O 
i i just do n't think he 's guilty . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i think he 's wrong , what he did , everything , he cheated on his wife , that 's so wrong , but -- that does n't make him a murderer , he 's just a cheater , he 's just a -- you know , like one hundred ten percent you know eighteen karat -- asshole , like i - mar - mark geragos called him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you probably think he 's guilty , or |||O O O O O O O O 
greg well -- yeah , no i , i think , i think ( ( the guy 's ) ) definitely guilty uh just based on , i have n't followed it all that closely , although you ca n't help but follow it closely because there 's so much crap on the news . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but uh no i - the -- uh the i think well first of all , you know i agree with you , i think cheating on your wife 's pretty low . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i think what happened i - it 's living the b - uh living large . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you could tell both of them uh you look some of the things they had , you know , he had a few bucks or so . ( ( ) ) finish , things were getting him down , uh you know , you know how it is , day after day though -- m - marriage is n't all that wonderful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
eh , you know and i do n't think he had faced that , and plus , you know , a lot of the neat stuff from the outside , and particularly amber frey , who i do n't particularly think is neat , but it was something that uh you know he went after |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
greg and so uh he figured , well -- these will , these things would get rid of her i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't , i do n't know why like his uh , the wife 's or the mother said divorce is an option i think . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
i know , that 's very powerful . |||O O O O O O O O 
not , you know , not murder and , oh , i mean , i do n't know . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but -- you know , i i can see , the guy was n't thinking right . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was screwed up , you know , a despicable human being and he , just -- you know , the easy way out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this 'll work , i guarantee i 'm too damn smart . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but you know what , it 's like i think they did n't want to find him guilty because remember when ~ oj was not found guilty ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O 
i mean , oh my god , the , you know , but it 's like , ~ la would have like , turned ~ la upside down , like all the , you know |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
christina i - it just , i do n't know what would happen if he was found guilty , but now i think they said that they wanted to prove that -- you know , okay , we 're not going to let this guy walk , like , do n't let this guy walk either , big high profile case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , yeah you have to look , see , i think the locale , that both of them took place , and one took place in ~ la , which is terribly open - minded and , uh , the other one took place in uh , mida - well , uh ( ( redoak ) ) city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and who , redwood city is one of those things that would , uh shift san francisco and ~ la to , uh , to a red state rather than a blue state if you let them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's very , very conservative there . |||O O O O O O O O

how closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what kind of sentencing should peterson receive ? |||O O O O O O O O 
um , uh , scott peterson trial . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the only reason i - i , uh , actually picked to do this one is i lived in redwood city , so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a um , it 's northern california . |||O O O O O O O O 
a where the trial 's at . |||O O O B-TRI O O O 
oh , you pick your own -- you pick your own topic ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a no , i just picked it . |||O O O O O O O O 
they just called me and i 'm like -- i heard scott peterson and i 'm like , yeah , i know what the question 's going to be about . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alithia yeah , i heard something about it . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i - i do n't know if he 's - if he 's guilty or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think he got into an argument with her and he pushed her . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and i think she fell and maybe she hit her head or something and it killed her , so he panicked . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
a i do n't think he -- you know , i thi - i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i don - eh , you know , because -- th - well , with the baby and stuff , you know , she was still pregnant at that time , so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alithia yeah , because i was really -- i was n't really following it that much because i was - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
alithia but -- ( ( but i 'd love to have his hair ) ) something just came off the ~ tv about the scott trial . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
alithia i 'm in south carolina . |||O O O O O O O 
i live in redwood city , which they actually moved the trial here a couple months into it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O 
a where he had committed the murders , so . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
a yeah , we 're a pretty small town , so our newspaper covers it a lot . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
still do , i 'm kind of sick of hearing about him , but -- e - hopefully this 'll be the end of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
once they sentence him ( ( i bet ) ) . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
hopefully , you know , if he 's guilty hopefully , you know , they find him guilty -- and hopefully they have evidence , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you know if they have , like , evidence and , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alithia you know , against him or whatever ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
there was so much evidence , you know , it 's -- a lot of it could n't be used , a lot of it was used in that , you know , what they used against him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how would -- did they , like , found , like , eh , you know , fingerprints or whatever ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , they brought the boat down , or a duplicate of the boat to , kind of , you know , get a feel for it but they had to remove it from redwood city because people were putting flowers in it in -- memory of laci and , you know , planting flowers around it and stuff , so it was pretty interesting . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alithia oh , yeah , that 's cool . |||O O O O O O O O O 
eh , did you all -- did you all know her , or ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a but i - -- what ? |||O O O O O O O 
alithia did you all know laci , or ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
a um , a friend of mine 's sister used to work in a maternity wear store and laci peterson , the day before she disappeared , was in her store maternity shopping . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a so , yeah , it was my friend 's sister -- who lives in modesto . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , so , it kind of hit close to home with her , she 's just -- you know , because she kind of felt like she knew her and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i think it 's very sad , you know , just hearing about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , it 's -- it 's -- a whole long process . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 've been at this for almost three years , so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , it 's almost been three years . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
oh , i thought it was just getting on ~ tv over here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a no . yeah , it might be over there , but it 's been on here for a long time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , it must 've just went local and then then went national |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , we 're close to the trial so of course it 's going to be in the newspaper every single day . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , it 's , you know , and the trial , the , um , what is it called , the verdict , was actually read by audio over the ~ tv . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it it 's pretty ( ( depressing ) ) |||O O O O O O O O O O 
is this the case that 's trying to , um , uh , they 're trying to - to get a new juror ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is that -- is that the one where somebody called a news - |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
a they 're trying to get a what ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
alithia a new * jural -- a new dir - -- they did ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a oh , they already did . |||O O O O O O O 
yes , a long time ago . |||O O O O O O O 
alithia because somebody had -- called the news people . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
they already did , a long time ago , um , actually a couple days before the verdict was was put on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alithia because that 's what they 're still talking about he - in these papers here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , they did that a while back . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
a so , it 's now getting wind to your area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so we 're - this - we 're so late over here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a you know , we get pretty much the information ( ( hey , it 's mom and , ) ) hold on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
4 . peterson trial scott peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife laci and their unborn son , and he now faces the death penalty . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
do you think he is guilty of the crimes he 's been convicted of ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if so , what were his motives ? |||O O O O O O O O 
how closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what kind of sentencing should peterson receive ? |||O O O B-TRI O O O O 
hi , my name is hillary . |||O O O O O O O 
could you hold on for a second ? |||O O O O O O O O 
hillary a pretty -- depressing topic for today . |||O O O O O O O O O 
kelly yeah , i guess so . |||O O O O O O O 
the truth is i do n't really , uh , i do n't really know much about that topic . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did n't really follow the trial very closely at all |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
hillary we do n't have , uh , cable so we purposely did n't watch the trial , but i read about it on the internet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
hillary he -- killed his wife when she was -- eight months pregnant and -- and dumped her in , uh -- the ocean , basically . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so why was it so special ? |||O O O O O O O 
why did that , uh -- particular case make -- the the national news ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary i think it 's because it was in such , it was like a , um |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary it was -- in such a quiet , upscale community where it happened and -- um just i think the fact of her being eight months pregnant , um , drew a lot of attention and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary of course people were worried about her for a long time and then they found her and blah blah blah . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was -- gossip , basically . |||O O O O O O O 
oh , but the mistress had nothing to do with the murder ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
hillary i think -- yeah , cause he found out , they found out he had a mistress , and then it was like , oh -- yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are -- i do n't think , i do n't think so , but who knows ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary very sad cause she has a child herself and so she drug her son through a lot of -- uh , drama that he did n't need to be part of . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she has a son too , so he he also got put -- um -- you know , in the spotlight a bit , from what i understand . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did n't , i do n't have tv though , so i do n't really know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh , the son of the , right right . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary of -- of his girlfriend , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i hear though , that he 's going to be -- the first person to be ( ( ) ) um -- uh -- killed for a crime in california in like , thirty five years or something . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary i do n't know if they 've , i do n't know if they 've -- um -- given him the death penalty yet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
but i think he would be the first in , in a really long time to actually -- be killed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
kelly um -- why , uh , now why did they decide that this was to be this big ( ( ) ) out of this with the most heinous crime in all of california ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
kelly i mean i guess that 's not how they decide who died , but it 's because of the |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
kelly the , uh , cou -, like the -- the court that they went to , like the area does n't |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary well , i do n't know why they decided on this , i think it was because it was so public of a case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but they have a lot of |||O O O O O O 
hillary they have many many worse crimes going on in california , parents killing their children and everything , that you would think -- would would , um -- you know , be |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary yeah , but they do n't , they ignore those because this one got on television , i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kelly keep like -- uh , the jury from watching ~ tv and the media and stuff . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i guess now ( ( it 's , uh ) ) -- pretty much impossible -- to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary i i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O 
i never really got the whole -- watching it on ~ tv and and getting into the whole -- mystery of it because , in the end , the woman 's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there 's -- really no way of changing that i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , uh , i think it 's kind of strange how it was so publicized . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
like i 'm just , seriously , like i do n't , like i try not to watch , like -- too much , like |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you ca n't help it sometimes . |||O O O O O O O 
but it just amazes me that , uh , i think it 's ridiculous how publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- i mean there 's like human rights violations going on all around the world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean there 's like , genocide in sudan right now but like , nobody talks about that . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh yeah and what 's going on in , i know and people -- flock , flock to the store to buy all their -- all their foreign made goods and it 's like what are you -- doing ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obviously they do n't really care about what 's going on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they just like to hear the details . |||O O O O O O O O 
maybe if they could hear the details about other things they would be more involved . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um ( ( ) ) it 's almost like , uh -- ( ( ) ) diversion but it just seems like they just make it into like , like a soap opera for people to watch , you know ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well you know , some people were glued to their ~ tvs for weeks , and it 's just to disturbing that that would be their -- their main entertainment during the day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hillary especially when there 's so many other things they could be doing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i could not sit around all day and watch a murder trial on ~ tv , especially with my kids around . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
4 . peterson trial scott peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife laci and their unborn son , and he now faces the death penalty . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
do you think he is guilty of the crimes he 's been convicted of ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
if so , what were his motives ? |||O O O O O O O O 
how closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what kind of sentencing should peterson receive ? |||O O O B-TRI O O O O 
a uh , there there 's something about this scott peterson trial , though , that the th - that i ca n't i ca n't recall hearing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
did the -- are they still going to try to get him with , uh , the death penalty or are they -- -- or are they going to be content with just , uh , just , you know , giving him life , uh , have heard about that ? |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
a i mean , are are they still going to go after him with al - with all their -- all of their ability ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eh , you know , are they -- are they s - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b i think if they do -- if they -- th - i think that they can -- because -- in california , uh , the baby was considered a person |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b and they had a little bit about that at church last week -- when i went to church services , or the week before , i ca n't remember , but , um , it -- i kind of thought then -- that , uh , when i first heard about the case , let me just back up a little bit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when i first -- heard the case , or about it , i -- told myself , if he did do it , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
a yeah , he probably did . |||O O O O O B-TRI O 
b and i think he did , |||O O O O O B-TRI O 
b uh , if he did do it , i -- thought to myself , he will probably get -- the maximum sentence of whatever it is |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
a well , he he he probably will , yeah . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
b because of the baby |||O O O O O 
b and , to me , i -- do n't believe even -- eh , exactly , you know , fetal state , i believe that that was a baby -- that could 've lived . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a right , a human being , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so , to me , i would n't -- he - it would n't 've been good if he -- if i had been on his jury . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mm , yeah , i see what you mean . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i could never vote , i mean , to let him go . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b i c - but , now , i do n't know that i would vote for a death penalty because i 'm not sure that a -- a death cancels out a death . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O 
b i 'm not -- -- i i do n't know , and -- i would n't really be able to vote -- on that because my father was killed at work . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
a oh , i 'm sorry to hear that . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
so , you think you -- -- so , you know , i i 've got two things that probably -- i would be disqualified on that kind of a jury . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i 'm pretty sure of it . |||O O O O O O O O O 
b but , uh , believe it or not , i do still feel sorry for him |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a uh , wh - yeah , i do too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i feel sorry for him . |||O O O O O O 
he 's going to be in the |||O O O O O O O 
b more so for his family -- m - more so for both families -- because i know that from my own experience , we 're the one 's that are left . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a well , he 's also being , uh , you know , dragged through , uh , the media , you know , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b now , to to me that was |||O O O O O O O O 
a the nation - wi - nation - wide med - the natio - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a oh , you mean being dragged through the media like that ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , it it is unfair , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you know , he 's having th - he 's having th - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b eh , i i do n't know , though , if it was because it was sensational lies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the case was so different |||O O O O O 
a w - well it was a - |||O O O O O O O O 
a it was a pretty sensational case , all right , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then when they drug in , i re - |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i ca n't -- that amber frey , and then also that , um , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , amber 's the attorney . |||O O O O O O O O 
b any time you bring in amb - er , i mean , allred , i 'm not against her , i like her , eh , at times , but -- when they brought her in -- and this other woman , i though , uh - oh , any chance he has of any -- of any kind of a trial that 's , uh , not what i call sensationalized , is over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , i agree with that , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a you know , she was , eh , in -- always ruling in , uh , in , uh , what was the word i was looking for , uh , possessive -- no , not possessive but protective -- of , um , of , uh , her client , um , just , um , wh - what was her name ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she was always ready to bite anyone 's head off that ha - had anything , you know , slightly wrong abo - you know , uh , ow , or amiss about amber . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , you know , you may think i 'm a little -- crazy , but at first when i heard about , uh , frey , when i first heard about her , i got worried that maybe it was -- both of them |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b because they 're -- i 've never totally -- believed -- that peterson did this all by himself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
she may have -- she may have , uh , planted the idea in his head , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yet something tells me , and -- i think -- that he actually -- was so involved her , th - amber , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b that if -- she had anything to do with this , i do n't think he would ever tell . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't believe he would ever tell on her . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
there was the impression i got . |||O O O O O O O 
i kind of , uh , watched him at different times when they would mention her |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , he he seemed to be be very vili - he seemed to be most most un - at - eh , un - at - ease |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b and i just think that |||O O O O O O 
a when they were talking about amber . |||O O O O O O O O 
and that caught my eye . |||O O O O O O 
i do n't know if it 's because i 'm a woman but , um , i thought , uh - oh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b because at that time , uh -- right now , i 've been , like , totally busy with , uh , holiday , you know , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do you think he is guilty of the crimes he 's been convicted of ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
if so , what were his motives ? |||O O O O O O O O 
how closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what kind of sentencing should peterson receive ? |||O O O O O O O O 
my name is jean , and i 'm in arizona . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
mohammed oh , from arizona , jean . |||O O O O O O O O 
jean i 'm fine , thank you . |||O O O O O O O O 
mohammed ah , this is mohammed , calling from new york . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jean mohammed , calling from new york . |||O O O O O O O O 
well , the topic is interesting , but they 've been having this one for three days . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know why they 're so obsessed with it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mohammed seems like it 's a weekend , or they want to get as much as they can feedback from people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jean i guess so , yes . |||O O O O O O O 
and so what do you think was - |||O O O O O O O O 
jean i i did n't actually -- watch the trial very much , uh th - in fact , i did n't watch the trial at all . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
jean i read about it in the newspaper and things like that . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
um , i do think from all the , uh , things that i have heard that he -- had to be guilty with all the evidence that they had , but um , i do n't really know why , uh , if everybody was so , sort of , obsessed about it when we 've got so much other -- things going on in the world that , uh , seem to me much more important , but um . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
perhaps it was because he seemed , uh , a very human kind of person and , and you cou - you could n't really understand why he would want to do something about that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i - i think his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend , but uh - -- kill his own first child that way is extraordinary . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
what do you think about it ? |||O O O O O O O 
being very frankly , i was not , uh , following the case at all even uh uh television , or uh reading , but from what i can observe , that it seems , eh , it has been talking -- -- taking too long time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
like one year almost , now . |||O O O O O O O 
it was -- taking so much time . |||O O O O O O O O 
the case is almost one year . |||O O O O O O O 
like last , uh , christmas if i 'm not , uh , recalling my memory . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so for one year , it 's really a good time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i 'm asking myself why it took such a long |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it may be because -- it 's quite important , or so there is so many everything 's , i mean , it 's , it 's a really different case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , the quo - the nice quotient is about the media . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the media have biased in this , |||O O O O O O O O 
i believe that media is a very good , uh , i mean , uh , way to give us all the opportunity to understand and see . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean without the media , you and i , how we will be knowing ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think they were biased in in -- favor of him , or in favor |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , i do n't think so . |||O O O O O O O O 
no , i did n't think so either from what i heard . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mohammed maybe -- sometimes in - in - in - in other issues they - they may be biased , but in this issue they were just -- covering what 's happening , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mohammed and , uh , they give us the picture . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a camera -- to give you the view . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think they were biased in this case here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , uh , what do you think will happen next ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , uh they 're coming up to the sentencing , and i heard yesterday or read in the newspaper or something that his brother -- i guess it was on the television . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the news , his brother was appealing -- for them to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death penalty , because -- he said he 's a very good listener and he cares about people , and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know whether that is true or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know that he had done a lot of volunteer things before , and that was the one things that made me wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody else who did it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i think given such as i have heard , even though like you , i did not follow the case day by day or anything like that , i do n't quite see how he could not be guilty if they 've got so much that appears to point to him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and what would be the motive for anybody trying to -- to get him if it was n't |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
5 . death of arafat ( 1 ) controversial plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
do you think arafat 's death will help or hurt the israeli- palestinian peace process ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
was arafat a good leader ? |||O O O O O O 
what do you think us policy should be toward palestine now that arafat has died ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what , if anything , should the us do to be involved in the middle east peace process ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco hi . wha - i did n't catch your name . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gandhi gandhi from new york . |||O O O O O O 
uh , i think it 's fresh topic for tonight . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
so what do you think ? |||O O O O O O 
well , um , i would - i would have to start - -- i would have to start , generally , in stating - -- stating what i think is the problem and -- - with the middle east and what - for me , one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- united states government gives so much aid to the state of israel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
in which , the state of israel buys -- many expensive military weapons , ah , which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of palestinians . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
so , for me , that 's -- the - that 's essentially the root of the problem . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , um , yasser arafat was kind of in a difficult position , because you have these , um , incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned , uh , palestinians , and if -- arafat had n't , um , tried to stand up -- and help them and - and fight for their rights , then -- m - they would n't have respected arafat , but then again , you know , he could n't be too friendly with the west , um , and , um , and so he did the best he could , i think . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a difficult -- leadership role . |||O O O O O O O O 
um , what do - well , how about you ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
gandhi i think , yeah , more or less , i c - i agree with what you said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's almost , this is my view as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and the question is , what next ? |||O O O O O O O O 
i mean , some idea -- from israeli side , they were saying -- he was a problem , and if he goes , everything will be quite easy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now he 's not in anymore . |||O O O O O O O 
so , let us wait and see . |||O O O O O O O O 
if he was a problem himself , hope - uh , the coming one -- will be in a good -- position to negotiate with the other side , israel , and then -- peace can be achieved . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , we have to wait and see , but , uh , it seems it 's not easy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco but , i , eh , i get the feeling that - -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we ca n't put it on -- the ro - or the - -- the whole responsibility of the pre - -- peace process ca n't be the leader of -- a - -- a group that is - -- i do n't know , in my view , has -- not ver - not very many resources to fight - -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land , that , you know , does n't allow them to really move around in their own country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , unless that -- stops , the , um , the leader of the palestinians -- really ca n't do too much -- to further the peace process , because -- there are -- a lot of bad things happening to the people -- of that -- leader . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco yeah , so it 's - -- it 's kind of , it 's - -- it seems like the , um , the media , at least in the united states , is -- putting all of this -- focus and responsibility on the leader of the palestinians , as if it was |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco arafat 's fault that any of - -- any of the violence was caused . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , it seems like an unfair treatment -- of - -- of , you know , the leader of -- the palestinian people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
actually , it - it 's a good topic to be choosing , i mean , uh , because it 's one of the fresh topics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how long have you been with the study ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
uh , this is probably my tenth or eleventh conversation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
almost the same like me . |||O O O O O O 
so , the other -- days , which one was quite interesting to you ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , well , there 's been a couple where -- they 've - they talked about the cabinet -- for -- bush , and bush has been , um , you know , selecting new cabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that i 'm - i do n't really know very well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , there 's been some topics where i 'm - i did n't have very much information . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
other topics -- you know , usually about the election that - -- that , um , i did have -- a lot of things , um , to say . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are you - are you , um , are you from the united states , or do you come from , uh - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gandhi i came from the area , i 'm from egypt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gandhi yeah , so i 'm - i 'm quite , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gandhi - cerned about , uh - -- uh , over there i mean . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
people , actually , they are waiting -- to , uh , to see peace is a fact . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
5 . death of arafat ( 1 ) controversial plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
do you think arafat 's death will help or hurt the israeli- palestinian peace process ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
was arafat a good leader ? |||O O O O O O 
what do you think us policy should be toward palestine now that arafat has died ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what , if anything , should the us do to be involved in the middle east peace process ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sue hi , my name is sue and i 'm from iowa . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm ben , i 'm from the bronx , new york . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
pouring raining here and cold . |||O O O O O O 
oh , well , it 's -- you should be getting a little bit of a reprieve , because our is getting a little more mild and -- we seem to get the little more mild weather right before you do , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i w - i want a little . |||O O O O O O O O 
yeah , we even , uh , grilled out the last couple of days , so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sue uh , well , my husband and i . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i 'm single , uh , have a - a boyfriend . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sue well , good for you . |||O O O O O O O 
and we 're talking about arafat here . |||O O O O O O O O 
um , well , when -- around the time he was he was getting the nobel peace prize and stuff , i think he got that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , there was a show here in new york at a big theater . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think maybe it was at lincoln center in the philharmonic theater or the metropolitan opera house or the new york state theater or something . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and arafat came in and got a standing ovation , you know , a peace prize winner bah bah bah bah bah . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the mayor of new york , who was then rudolph giuliani , stood up and walked out , he was also in attendance , and his , uh , comment to the press afterwards was that , you know , he just did n't want to honor a terrorist , and i -- one of the few things that i was happy about with giuliani when he was mayor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , giuliani got very popular later because of the - the |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ben world trade center thing but he - he was n't so popular as a mayor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ben but , you know , i - i kind of agreed with that arafat thing , though . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i -- but i do think he accomplished something in that the palestinian people do have a legitimate grievance and he put it on the map , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sue well , he - -- he did but i think he really failed miserably , in my opinion , when he , um , refused to sign that treaty that was originally set up because it was a wonderful -- option and it really could 've re - done some wonderful things for his people and i think he really did them a disservice by not taking care of it at that time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , what was the treaty ? |||O O O O O O O 
i 'm not familiar with it . |||O O O O O O O 
sue well , um , where they were going to , uh , give them , like , ninety - six percent of the ga - of - of gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred percent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and so he refused to sign it . |||O O O O O O O O 
it was just an - an incredible faux pas on his part , from my opinion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , y - it 's - it 's -- you have to sometimes take a little bit less than you want , you know , uh , an - and ninety - six percent is a big percentage , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i think that could have really done some wonderful uh steps for -- uh for the palestinian people uh as a whole . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i felt -- very sad that , um , that that was n't -- done . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , it was really quite unfortunate that - that he -- that he was not willing to , um , step forward -- to do - do what was really in the best interests of his people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ben sometimes - sometimes i th - i think it 's hard when - when you 're the - the first leader , or the george washington of something , to see things other than in black and white . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , or maybe he did n't have the gift of - of nuance that would 've helped him to - -- to take that right step , uh , you know , the - -- the -- his people suffer so terribly and maybe , you know , it could have been better if he had signed that , huh . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sue i really think so . |||O O O O O O 
i really , truly do and now it 's a - a situation where , with his passing , um , i think there 's a real , um , new opening , a new possibility for - -- some extremely positive steps to come forward out of this -- i do think that the united states -- will probably be requested to be involved in the negotiation process and i understand that , i me - uh , because , um , i think -- both sides -- have a trust in the united states that make it - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we 've ha - we have a history , uh , clinton and carter w - worked over there -- - try to get some peace going . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they they they worked very personally . |||O O O O O O O 
they had those retreats and things with the leaders , |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
and stuff , and uh -- that 's why we should be there but i 'm i 'm kind of scared of the people -- that represent the united states now , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're not quite the same caliber . |||O O O O O O O O 
sue well , that 's really true , um , but it - it is a -- i mean , we are having a - a -- step forward in a lot of ways , um . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we - we , i think , do have some potentials , um , to do some extremely positive , um , um , things . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
5 . death of arafat ( 1 ) controversial plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
do you think arafat 's death will help or hurt the israeli- palestinian peace process ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
was arafat a good leader ? |||O O O O O O 
what do you think us policy should be toward palestine now that arafat has died ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what , if anything , should the us do to be involved in the middle east peace process ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul hi , this is paul . |||O O O O O O O 
and my name is rainia and i 'm in eureka , california . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
opposite sides of the coast . |||O O O O O O 
well , that 's an interesting question they 're asking . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul yeah , it is , uh , the past couple of topics have been -- more controversial than -- the early topics -- and , uh , well , i 'm - i 'm very opinionated . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm happy to talk about it . |||O O O O O O O O 
rainia yeah , go right ahead . |||O O O O O O O 
paul well , um , yasser arafat was -- was he a good leader ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i i think -- that , uh , he -- he 's -- pretty much -- -- or he was pretty much -- following what he had always done , even as a young man , uh , back in algeria -- when - when he led the -- terrorist attacks against the french to kick them out of -- algeria . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i - i think he was doing the same thing there in palestine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i - i do n't think , eh , i do n't think he really knew how to , uh , take on the role of - of peacemaker . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , i 'm - i 'm -- you know , i could be wrong . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i - it seems like that - that was always a problem for him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , i 'm not sure myself uh how good a leader he was . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i i -- it 's hard to get the truth w - when the -- when the there 's so many uh slanted uh -- information |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rainia especially on the main media . |||O O O O O O O 
rainia i do n't -- like the way -- israel has been -- going after the palestinians |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think ariel sharon is a lot like yasser arafat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i -- ca n't understand why the two of them -- did n't see the similarities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , and they were asking -- too , of -- about the , should the ~ us be involved -- in that whole thing ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that - that 's interesting , too , because -- cutting yasser arafat out of the whole thing was - -- was really -- george bush 's decision . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think -- personally , he did n't like him because he thought he was a - -- a liar -- so he refused to -- have anything to do with him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rainia uh , which - which bush are you talking about ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul ev - everything kind of stopped when - -- when he became president and all , uh , activity regarding -- israel , palestine stopped . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and israel pretty much could do what they wanted . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
an - and you 're right , it did n't seem fair at all . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rainia yeah , there 're -- th - well , the way i see it , eh , bush , eh , has a right -- wing christian , right - wing agenda . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he he 's -- some -- how thinks that -- if israel has -- -- i 'm not sure that all -- their prophecies are -- but there 's something about -- if -- they can -- get rid of the palestinians , that will somehow , um , their prophecy -- coming true and th - and then -- somehow -- i do n't -- i - we do n't -- understand what on earth they 're |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rainia trying to achieve with this but i - it seems like a - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul that sounds kind of scary . |||O O O O O O O 
rainia a christian agenda , yeah , that that -- that , uh , the end of the world , the end times -- if , um , israel takes over -- palestine that 's h - some -- has something to do with the end times . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's really -- frightening the way they talk -- and , um , i do n't think he 's qualified to be involved in this at all . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it never was right to begin with n - and , you know , we - we 're - we 're only given certain information and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rainia hard to really know the whole -- real story of what 's going on over there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rainia that what the israelis are doing is wrong . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
by going into their territory and building these walls or building settlements -- pushing the palestinians out and -- palestinians -- fight -- with rocks and -- sticks and -- israelis have their machine guns and bulldozers and -- i just -- t - really unpalatable that the -- whole idea , the -- the way they 're going about -- this thing and -- i do n't really feel qualified -- to say how it should be , but -- i -- see it -- being wrong to -- hurt children and -- innocent people . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O

5 . death of arafat ( 1 ) controversial plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
do you think arafat 's death will help or hurt the israeli- palestinian peace process ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
was arafat a good leader ? |||O O O O O O 
what do you think us policy should be toward palestine now that arafat has died ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what , if anything , should the us do to be involved in the middle east peace process ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
barb i 'm barb from indiana . |||O O O O O O O 
roger okay , i 'm roger from , um , atlanta . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , what do you think about -- arafat ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , i think that , um , i bet he was n't a really good leader . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that , um , that his situation -- -- well , see i got to the -- to - to the level of power that he was in -- back in the eighties -- and once he , um , you know , started getting wealthy and started getting known , that his agenda ch - uh , changed |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roger but it was n't actually for peace but was to try to find a way to ( ( send ) ) the israelis out of jerusalem in the areas that they wanted . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i really do n't think that -- they wanted to coexist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that , um , he wanted -- you know , all his people -- all his people wanted to coexist with the -- israelis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that , um , his death -- marks a beginning of trying to find somebody that -- really wants peace . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think that in that area of the , um , world that you could actually have peace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you know the bible well you would know that there 's always going to be a conflict there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
um , i think that , uh , the united states should open up -- their -- doors to -- not help , but support any , um , process for peace in the area , though . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think that we should get involved to a level , a point where we 're sending people over there and , um , trying to -- help keep the peace or anything like that , um . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's a lot of stuff that can be done -- by just verbal suppo - -- you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that now he 's gone , his family is still around , and |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
roger uh , millions and millions of dollars that he had is still around but they -- if they bring people in that was n't involved with his cabinet , n - um , have different views than him , somebody that gener - genuinely can accept the fact that the israel - -- is - israelis are there and they 're there to stay -- and , um , we going to have to find a way to coexist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if they can find somebody like that , then i think that they should f - support him and , um , and back him up -- in trying to help define -- peace in the area where peace is impossible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what do you think about it ? |||O O O O O O O 
i did n't know that much about it , i was n't much into politics back in the eighties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was more , um , kind of a -- i was a kid on the run from abusive parents back then so that was n't a , you know , one of my topics of interest at the time , it is now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , i -- my roommate , and i still do n't know that much about -- i 'd love to know more about politics and i 'm trying to learn more , uh , tells me , you know , he was such a terrible man but , eh , i do n't listen to everything he says . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i think it -- -- i mean , it would be nice to have peace over there , but i agree with you , i do n't think it 's ever going to happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , not the way -- -- not the way they 'll -- -- not like it is here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i agree that we should n't send people over there . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
we 've got enough stuff going on with |||O O O O O O O O 
barb iraq and i - and , um , the -- other -- -- the other guy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we got way too much going and too much expense , i mean , we we ca n't , the that 's |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
barb that would be just putting it over the edge right there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i think ought support , you know , a man that , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
barb like you said , is -- would like to coexist -- with everybody and somebody that is |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
barb peaceful -- and , i do n't know , i 'd like to learn more about the bible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my parents never took me to church or anything . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
barb i 'd like to -- i know that , you know , there 's been problems , a lot of conflict over there , and it seems like no matter what , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
barb just like iraq ye - eh , we try to go in and get peace and - and how long has it been and , i mean , i think saddam needed to be removed but it 's - -- there 's just -- s - all these people that are going to follow him no matter what . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roger yeah , and , um , i only know about yasser arafat because i , um , study international affairs a little bit -- and i know -- a very little bit about him because , of course he was a , um , leader for a long time , longer than the age that i am -- old , so , but i - i - i - i 've noticed -- on throughout my studies that -- what he represented to the public -- was -- what he represented to the international public -- was not what he was representing to his people -- and he was representing , um , peace with the israelis and he was representing trying to find ( ( the whites or ) ) divide the land so that it would be , um , stop , um , uh , war and terrorists in the area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
but i do n't think that he had the same image to - to his people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that it was a front -- for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community , but i think -- that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the israelis out -- maybe closer to the gaza strip , and to re -take jerusalem -- and other cities near jerusalem , and to , uh , uplift his people in a way that -- they could say , you know , we conquered the israelis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
it 's a matter of , uh -- i mean , it 's more than just land , it 's a , um , conflict of - -- of , um , hatred , uh , and racism , i mean , eh , different types of people , um , they do n't like each other , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
5 . death of arafat ( 1 ) controversial plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
do you think arafat 's death will help or hurt the israeli- palestinian peace process ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
was arafat a good leader ? |||O O O O O O 
what do you think us policy should be toward palestine now that arafat has died ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what , if anything , should the us do to be involved in the middle east peace process ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark i - -- my name is mark . |||O O O O O O O O O 
my name is ali , uh , |||O O O O O O O 
ali uh , so let me ask you , do you think arafat was , uh , a good leader or not ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark um , to hi - -- yeah , i - -- i think he did what he thought -- was right for his people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would say he was a good leader -- for - -- for , uh , his people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and as far as our involvement there , should be as little as possible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just let them do -- what they , you know , what they 're going to do -- and we should stay out of it ( ( just ) ) as -- much as we can . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , this country seems to get involved too much in other people 's politics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
should just let them do whatever they 're going to do , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ali mm , by the way i am from arab origin , so i also have , uh , uh , the same opinion -- like you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i believe he -- -- in my opinion he - he was a good leader -- and , um , i believe what , eh , has to be done -- right now is to ( ( apply ) ) -- the united nations ' , uh , decisions about the conflict between arab and israel because there is -- -- there are a lot of , uh , decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this , uh - for example , one of them was , uh , decision number two forty - two -- and this was about -- the ha - establishing two - two countries , one for israel and another one for palestine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ali so , if we -- -- eh , if united states , bush , israel ( ( told ) ) th - the solution or to , uh , to make the decision , eh , i think this will solve -- the problem . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the -- unfortunately what happens right now - -- the -- for example , which is -- little bit toward it 's - it 's interest . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for example , when there was , uh , like , a -- decision against iraq , the united states -- went directly -- to iraq to -- -- for , eh , uh , an invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons - -- she even was out , uh , putting any attention to the united nations , uh , like , uh , approval . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she did wha - what she want . |||O O O O O O O O 
but , eh , eh , for israeli , palestinian conflict there 's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until now -- she did n't put any pressure , eh , toward ( ( this and ) ) and i believe this policy has been , uh , this kind of policy , eh , um , eh , became more and more during -- eh , during , uh , eh , bush -- -- president bush time . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for example , before , eh , during clinton , i believe at that time -- clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and i believe at that time , if you remember , um , yasser arafat -- and , uh , the prime minister of israel , his name was barak , they met together in the white house -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during clinton , eh , period -- they had , uh , this ( ( oslo ) ) a - eh , agreement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most of the big problems between the two parties , they negotiated everything almost and there is -- there were , like , final steps that have to be solved . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , uh , i think if there was , like , the , um , the same policy has to be followed after clinton . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think -- everything would - -- - finished then - -- the -- i think united states -- went to another direction and , eh , they forgot about this problem right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark yeah , i g - eh , see , i do n't , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark um , when - when policy is set by one -- -- by one president -- towards - towards one thing , it 's usually -- followed through , if there is something to follow through , by the -- next president in turn . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he is more or less obligated -- to continue , uh , the process that was already started -- but -- i think -- bush 's -- agenda -- is not -- towards that right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is not his priority , i do n't think . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
ali yeah , i think so , yes . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and , eh , uh , although , you know , it 's been a long time -- that -- i - they have both -- b - both israel and palestine , they both need a -- they both need their own country -- and - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ali that 's , uh , true because , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark an - -- eh , y - |||O O O O O O O O 
ali in the united nations they have established -- eh , they made this decision already . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ali the -- uh , there , uh -- there has to be two countries , one of them for palestine , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ali and another one for israeli but , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O 
mark i - i - i agree a hundred percent , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark eh , but to get so involved in it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think , the people , uh , the people that are in charge , the - eh , the people that run the governments there -- do need to sit down an - and - and be in touch with each other and if they need a mediator or something like that , that - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ali which is played by u - united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
this is the mediator which , in my opinion , is the one |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ali who has the power to convince both -- parties -- about - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , i - -- they -- in -- |||O O O O O O O O O 
mark it 's a -- -- eh , that i - -- that is what is need and un - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark unfortunately they 've been -- they 've been trying to get this settled and hashed out for -- twenty - five , thirty years now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark i - it 's been a long time in coming and anything that 's good is worth waiting for , you know what i mean ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eh , i mean , that 's what i 've always been told . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

but with this peterson guy -- he looks so cool and reserved but , uh , it 's like nothing 's phasing him , and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think he did it ? |||O O O O O O O 
paul when they read the verdict he he did n't even flinch , did n't even blink . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , do you think he did it ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
paul i went , wow , that 's kind of weird . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul well , i - it makes me think that he probably did it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ken eh , he , eh , w - it seemed like he covered his tracks , though , i mean , they have no evidence other than the bodies that they found . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , it 's crazy , but , they 're saying where they 're going to put him th eh , in the same prison next to charles manson or something like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , so they can be buddies or something , i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ken but i do n't think he 's going to last in jail if he goes to jail , i mean . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they talking abou - -- how do you feel about this death penalty thing ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul well , jeez , i i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
eh , i mean , i do n't thin - i mean , i i i do n't think that he should suffer that , you know , i think he should , um , i do n't think that he should suffer that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , if if he does live and he is in prison , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul he 'll probably get some wacky woman -- who wants to marry him , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
paul get married two or three times in there . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
ken yeah , that reminds me of the central park , uh , guy robert chambers in new york city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm surprised they have n't made a big , big -- thing out of it , eh , he just got busted last week for some -- something . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , um , i think he s - m - was meeting women in the jail like that , too , when he was there , but he just got out of doing fifteen years and , you know , he was just , eh , central park , he had , uh , well , rough sex or something , with a woman in the park and they said he strangled her , or |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
paul oh , sure , the preppy guy . |||O O O O O O O O O 
ken yeah , the preppy guy , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O 
they caught him last weekend doing something , but , uh , he driving without a license or whatever . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul yeah , just always always in trouble now . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
6 . criminal trials / peterson scott peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife laci and their unborn son , and he now faces the death penalty . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's been a lot of media coverage of the peterson trial . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
why do you think this trial has been so publicized ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
what other criminal trials have gotten a lot of media attention , and why ? |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
what 's the most memorable criminal trial you can recall ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
winnette hi , this is winnette , in michigan . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
irvin hi this is irvin , sullivan , illinois . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , what do you know about this scott -- peterson trial ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i do n't know much about it , to be honest with you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh this is funny because i just , one of my calls the other day was regarding this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so uh uh they 're act - -- actually that 's getting a few different questions and -- actually the gentleman i got the other day -- had n't even heard about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well um , i 've been following it pretty closely . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , i guess because of -- you know it being a mother and -- being pregnant for a baby . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , kind of hit more to -- i you know to home . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so you -- how much of it have you followed ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
did , did you -- follow any of it at all when it was on in the news or in the papers or anything ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
irvin hardly any of it at all , because -- um -- for one thing -- i do not have a ~ tv or a radio and i do n't get a daily newspaper . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
irvin we get a weekly newspaper . |||O O O O O O O 
um , well i 'll i do n't get any newspapers at the house , but -- i listen to the radio every morning on my way to work and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
winnette and uh -- when it first happened it was -- pretty publicized on every radio station um -- it come across -- on the news and we keep our ~ tv on at my work , because we have a customer waiting area , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
winnette um actually one of our employees had wa - watched ( ( happening ) ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
-- so from that point on we kind of -- talked a lot about it at work and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how long ago was it ? |||O O O O O O 
um , it was a year -- almost a year ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because it was just before christmas -- that it happened . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
irvin over a year ago . |||O O O O O O 
um , i 'm thinking -- i do n't know , november , december , i 'm not sure exactly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i know it was just before christmas -- when they had uh -- it had happened , because she was missing during christmas and then they had found her body . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they -- they found the baby as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
um , so when they found the baby , the baby of course had been -- they do n't know if the baby was born , through delivery , or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse i guess |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
irvin so the baby was separate . |||O O O O O O O 
um , actually she was pregnant for the baby . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
but the baby was separate from the body when he found it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , i do n't know if ma - |||O O O O O O O O O 
i you know i do n't know the whole story for sure , but -- um -- he had -- you know , obviously -- denied that he was involved anything to do with it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then they found out that he was having an affair on her . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and -- then of course when they were investigating him -- he tried running . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dyed his hair and -- grew out a mustache and -- they caught him trying to run with -- quite a bit of cash . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
winnette he 's -- in all honesty been guilty all along the way but |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
winnette of course you know they 've got to give him that reasonable doubt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so is he is he still um -- in prison now ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they 're making the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty , or life in prison . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
so that 's what 's is up in the air right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what state is this in ? |||O O O O O O 
winnette and -- um -- |||O O O O O 
i know i had , it was supposed to have be deliberated on -- the twenty - second of november , but they had an issue happen with -- one of the jurors -- so it 's postponed everything . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , actually they were trying to pass a law , and i do n't know if it ever did take into effect , that if in fact a mother was killed , and pregnant , um -- for there to be a double murder charge . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
winnette and -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
winnette and -- so it 's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- i believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
so he did n't get both first degree murders . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
um , i guess because he did n't murder the baby directly . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
winnette i 'm thinking maybe was the difference . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and because of the the charge on the baby , they could n't automatically give him the death penalty , but -- obviously there 's enough -- um , complaints or whatever |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what was his excuse for doing something horrible like that ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
winnette and -- well he still denies everything . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but the only thing they can figure is that maybe -- he wanted back into the bachelor life , and did n't want to be a father , did n't want to be tied down with a wife and child |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so he did n't have any other children ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
winnette that was -- no , that was going to be their first . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and actually i do n't even think they were married that long , maybe a year or two . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
9 . elections did you vote in the recent us presidential election ? |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what did you think of the two candidates , george bush and john kerry ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what about the vice presidential candidates , dick cheney and john edwards ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what issues were most important to you in deciding who to vote for ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you did n't vote , why not ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
lynn hi , my name is lynn . |||O O O O O O O O 
oh , so the topic is elections . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O 
lynn and i voted for , uh , not bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i guess , uh , you voted for kerry then , right . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dave yeah , are you in a blue or a red state ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dave a blue or a red state ? |||O O O O O O O O 
lynn i 'm from missouri -- i 'm in missouri . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
dave i forget which is which . |||O O O O O O O 
well i b - really do n't even look at it like that , but i should know that , should n't i ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dave yeah , i 'm in indiana -- so , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and we were kind of split in the middle i think so i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
maybe we 're half blue and half red . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so , you voted for bush , then ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
no , i i voted for kerry . |||O O O O O O O O 
but , uh , i live in a kind of a staunchly -- republican state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , there was really no way for my vote to make a difference . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn which , you know , i i just think the electoral votes -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know what 's wrong with everybody just taking , you know , a head count and voting |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn and doing away with the * electorials . |||O O O O O O O O O 
well , you know , you 're you 're talking about , um , the constitution there , so , i mean , you know , it takes a lot to change the constitution . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know they 're also -- i 've been reading some articles lately about they 're -- thinking about , uh , uh , why should only a native born person be allowed to , uh , be president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
that is kind of interesting to -- think that , i mean , i think it 'll be a long time before -- they would change that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dave yeah , but , uh , just in the last uh , well , actually just in the last month or so i -- is really the only time i 've ever heard anybody even even talk about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , uh , well , i i -- i did read a a column today by , uh , a hispanic fellow and , uh , he was n't native born , he was from cuba , and , uh , he stated that , uh , we he was in the fifth grade and and , uh , uh , he was taking -- no , i guess he was in middle school and he was taking a civics class and and it was pointed out to him that , you know , he could never become president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and he stated at that time , you know , he said , well , okay i ca n't be president i 'll never , you know , get involved in politics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , you know , he kind of thought that was unfair . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , you know , in one sense it is but then , i mean -- well , my grandparents came over , ellis island and everything , but when i think about , you know , a foreign person or maybe born in another country and coming here it doe - it does n't seem right in one sense for -- for them to be able to be president of this country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn but -- it kind of falls like -- i mean i 've been on the internet lately and i 've ran across these really weird websites -- and i 'm not a fanatic or anything but they 're all about the -- the new world , one world government and things like that , you know , and to me it 's just another point in that direction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn that wo n't make a you know , twenty or thirty , forty , fifty years down the road . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dave right , eh , so what do you think about george bush ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn i i think he 's a phony . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , that 's another thing they were talking about that he is with the skull and bones from i think he went to yale , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn and so was his father and and clinton was , too , and and people actually that + alumina |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dave and kerry was a skull and bones , also . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn also , yeah , and then they -- i do n't know what else they 're called but they 're saying , like , they were like satan people , satan worshipers and , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn you know , and you do n't know what to believe . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i watched a show on channel nine about bush and him being religious , spiritual , of course , but also religious when his father was n't , and -- i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i i think it 's all a bunch of lies , and -- i i do n't i 'm not crazy about bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 're some things about him , you know , the fact that he does act spiritual and things like that , i like that , i think that 's what got him in office but , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well what do you think of him as a man ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think he 's , uh , a good man or do you think he 's got -- any good qualities , or |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lynn uh , i -- you know , i want to say that he probably is but then i look at the things like where he wants -- the things he 's done . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that people are poorer . |||O O O O O O O 
i mean , i just think the um , we 're so much more in debt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i just do n't think he -- -- but as far as the man himself , i again , i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what do you think of him ? |||O O O O O O O 
well , i i think i think his dad was a better man than he is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , to me , you know , i 'm kind of in the same boat you 're in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think he was just he 's kind of the sizzle , you know , he 's not the steak . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think he was just sold to the american people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
9 . elections did you vote in the recent us presidential election ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what did you think of the two candidates , george bush and john kerry ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what about the vice presidential candidates , dick cheney and john edwards ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what issues were most important to you in deciding who to vote for ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you did n't vote , why not ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
obo hello , my my name is obo in ithaca , new york |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ted hi , my na - -- hey , my name is ted and i 'm in jacksonville , florida . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obo oh , nice , sounds like it 's a lot warmer down there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh yeah , sun 's shining , it 's a beautiful day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obo yeah , i guess the elections , ah -- basically , who did you vote for , and the vice presidential candidates , and why , and i 'll be honest with you |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obo i did n't vote for either of those . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
obo i did vote , but i i do n't vote for the main party |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obo ever , i usually try to stay out of the main party , because i think , and this last election showed that both are very brutal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
obo um , yeah i think that the , uh |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a very brutal election . |||O O O O O B-TRI O 
obo yeah , yeah , it 's , yeah , you 're absolutely , yeah , and i 'm sorry , i mean , if you want to add anything i 'm sorry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no no , go ahead , go ahead . |||O O O O O O O O O 
obo and , ah -- it 's , it 's just that -- like , i i just , i think that the last fifty years , the government has been mes - messed up by both these parties , honestly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , i , i usually do third party -- um , and the way it was working this year was that the democrats really pushed to get ralph nader off the ballot |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obo in every state , and um -- i mean , the republicans sort of tried to play like they were helping him out , but they knew they they did n't really have to because they knew the democrats were already doing more damage to keep him off the ballot and they were successful , and for a progressive party that was very brutal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obo and i was n't really impressed by either of the two vice presidential candidates , i know dick cheney seems to be running the show |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obo and , ah -- i mean , and , and a lot of it has to do -- and then , i just did n't know much , john edwards seemed nice , but he just , you know , he was just , he just got elected to the senate , and , i was n't really familiar too much with hi - i mean , i think it 's great that he got into the vice presidential role , but -- again , it 's the whole parties that i 'm really not really i do n't like their policies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ted well , you kind of hit on some of my sentiments , um , i 'm a fifty - year - old black male , and this was my first election that i participated in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
and the reason was was that , ah , i 'm retired air force -- and before , ah , because i was in the military -- ah , did n't did n't really think that my vote , um , counted one way or the other , that 's that was my thinking . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , i had a role to fulfill and regardless of how i voted , uh , i was going to have to fulfill that role . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ted the , the situation , though , now that i 'm out and , in the civilian sector , um , i find that the economics as far as home -- is what i 'm most concerned with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and because of the economic situation , i do n't think that 's being addressed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yes , i feel very , very bad in regards to the , ah , nine - eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O 
ted um , but i think so much attention is being paid to that -- that -- as you mentioned , over the past fifty years , the two parties that run the country -- um , have definitely taken a , um -- streamlined approach to whatever their agenda may be and not the will of the people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you said it very well . |||O O O O O O 
i totally , you coul - i could n't have said it better . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ted now it 's uh -- and as time goes on , you know , like , ah , what are we , you know , headed for , what are we faced with ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ted i mean , if we do n't start looking inward and start taking care of things at home -- uh , right now , yeah , we are the biggest power in the world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i heard a commentary by rush limbaugh , ah , the other day , and the comment was made was that there always is going to be a big dog on the street . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and right now i 'm proud to be , ah , you know , behind the big dog , meaning the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if i - if if -- the united states is not the big dog , some power in the world is going to step up and be just that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we got so many crises and tension uh what do you -- hot spots in the world , that , uh , instead of getting better , it seems to be growing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we got , uh , what is it , iran ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , right behind iraq there . |||O O O O O O O 
and then north korea , which is , you know , always volatile . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , you know , those situations are not getting any better , you know ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ted and as far as -- you know , i mean , what are we going to do ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we can - we can not -- police the whole world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
elections did you vote in the recent us presidential election ? |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what did you think of the two candidates , george bush and john kerry ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what about the vice presidential candidates , dick cheney and john edwards ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what issues were most important to you in deciding who to vote for ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you did n't vote , why not ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
ivan hi , this is ivan in wisconsin . |||O O O O O O O O O 
oh , i 'm -- i grew up in , uh , hour north of milwaukee , like , eh , uh , west bend , er , uh , fort washington area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan yeah , i 'm , uh , between lake geneva and kenosha . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , man i thought i , uh , put this whole election stuff behind me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
ivan yeah , i - in fact , i thought we already had a discussion on this , uh , about elections some time back , but i guess it was -- question was framed differently , i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john and , um , elections wore me down . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
i was pretty tired of all that , you know , all the commercials and all the hype and -- i do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it it we have lunch at work and -- the whole lunch time all you do is see commercials about the -- politicians and , you know , all that kind of stuff , um , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan yeah , i , uh , i voted . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
um , uh , and , uh , yeah , i -- feel the same way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i get -- regardless of what year it is or who the candidates are i get tired of listening to it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it -- basically all of it 's the same thing all the time and , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan they , uh , tell you the same thing and then they turn around and -- do something different all the time anyway , so it 's -- i do n't know if it 's , uh , i guess it 's wor - -- worth voting , but -- sometimes i wonder . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
was n't , uh , wisconsin was like a swing , er , uh , they were really pu - or no it was ohio , i think , was the really , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan yeah , ohio was th - the big swing one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan uh , uh , it was , uh , it went , uh , what color was it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blue i guess it was . |||O O O O O O 
well , my parents live back there still . |||O O O O O O O O O 
in fact , we just got back from disney world , you know , about an hour ago and they 're down there and they 're but they 're both , uh , |||O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john one 's one and one 's the other |||O O O O O O O O O 
john so they arg - you know , they just go and vote and cancel each other out , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , uh , kind of funny , so . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i guess we 'll just have to see what happens with , uh , mr. bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hopefully it 's -- good choice , you know , |||O O O O O O O O O O 
john i di - i did n't have a lot of faith in any of them , really , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john er , i mean , i -- i did n't really know what was the perfect choice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , they 're , ah , i ca n't ever remember a perfect choice and i 've been voting since , uh , nixon mcgovern , uh , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan i , uh , i 'd - i 've never -- ever seen a perfect candidate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan th - that 's to be expected , i mean , you know , they 're all human beings . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , uh , as far as what i thought of the various candidates , uh , you know , i guess we -- said what we said about bush , but , uh , kerry , i do n't know , it 's just that -- - coast , uh , kind of persona or image , - t , uh , i -- do n't care for , for one thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan from massachusetts i - -- - candidate . |||O O O O O O O O O 
ivan and , uh , cheney -- which he 's kind of out your way , uh , wyoming . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ivan uh , uh , he 's kind of a non-descript person , as far as , like i i 'm sure he 's he 's probably a nice guy , and -- a lot of fun at a party probably , i do n't know , but , you know , just from -- what you see of him , he 's just kind of -- kind of like an old grandpa , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john yeah , he 's real grouchy . |||O O O O O O O O 
john in those debates he was like a pitbull . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , he would c - him and , uh , i mean , uh , i do n't know , he he kind of picked apart edwards |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john and , um , but then -- edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about edwards too , about the , uh , how he 's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and , um , you know , there - there 's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that , you know , obviously they want to tell you |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john that i did n't like . |||O O O O O O O 
and , i guess i did n't really like that , uh , uh , kerry was , like , changing his story all the time , like , oh , i - -- i believe in this but , uh , no i do n't but yes i do and , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm kind of a cut and dry kind of a guy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you got an opinion i 'd rather just want you to tell me straight up and not |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john try to beat around the bush to -- get my vote or something like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i guess to a certain degree they -- they , uh , i guess try to play to the middle and try to -- please as many people as they can but kerry was just all over the map . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
elections did you vote in the recent us presidential election ? |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what did you think of the two candidates , george bush and john kerry ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what about the vice presidential candidates , dick cheney and john edwards ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what issues were most important to you in deciding who to vote for ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you did n't vote , why not ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
hello , it 's marco from illinois . |||O O O O O O O O 
derek hello , this is derek from austin , texas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
hi , nice to meet you . |||O O O O O O O 
so , uh the election , um -- the , um -- let 's see , overall i felt -- ju - just give you a brief -- summary , i felt -- that -- john kerry and edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm , i do n't know , i guess just in terms of policy i did n't -- i did n't , uh , find -- that as compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco felt like i could trust kerry -- uh , little bit more even though he was much more of a politician than bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco uh , he was -- kind of a smooth talker and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco um -- uh -- seems like a politician , they way he presented |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco his you know his his um argument . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but -- uh -- strangely i felt like that what , that was -- one of -- one of his good qualities because i did n't feel bush was politician enough . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that um -- one of the -- issues that i was concerned about was just -- the representation of the united states and -- on the international stage |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco and i just -- uh -- i uh -- i do n't know , uh , bush is -- the way he presents um -- the ~ us position -- uh -- seemed a little -- abrasive to me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i -- felt like , hm -- if we 're trying to , um -- make -- um -- the united states safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the , they care about diplomacy and -- uh , even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a nicer way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco yeah , it seems ( ( i make ) ) kind of simplistic , but -- that was -- an important thing for me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek um -- i was a little different . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i i i agree with everything you said . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i just , um -- i come from a little different background as far as being -- i was never into politics and now i i actually have gotten into god much more and and , you know , searching spirituality out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek generally people like that are conservative , you know , |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek uh , with their views because of different things like abortion and , and , uh , pro -life and -- all that kind of thing so i came form that background |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek eh , but that was just an added bonus for me in the fact that -- i too was obviously at this point in time concerned about the welfare of our security -- and i felt personally that if -- kerry was in office we 'd kind of be , uh -- up a creek without a paddle because i think -- he is so laid back -- um , and not as aggressive as bush that at this point in the game , where we 're at -- we 're in this thing full full -- steam ahead |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek and for a transition to occur at this point -- to someone who is laid back -- and not as aggressive as him i think would actually endanger the ~ us even more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that the international , uh uh , leaders would look at kerry and know , they 're very smart , i mean they 're -- they 're on top of these things , they know , you know , it would , it just would have opened a gateway . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek that , uh , it may have actually put us in more danger . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at least bush has -- pulled out the gun , you know , stick to them , and um -- you know , that 's where i was coming from on that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek i listen to a lot of talk radio and when i heard the stuff about kerry back in the -- the the , apparently the scandals he 's pulled as far as the uh , medals when he served time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , uh -- i listen to a lot of talk radio and spoke with , you know , heard from a lot of , uh -- veterans -- and they said it was physically , uh , impossible for him to achieve what he said he did . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and all the meetings he 's missing , and just , you know , i think it 's more of a status quo for him . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think he 's more , he got so much money that i think he was just concerned with attaining this position and a title . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek you know ( ( flag ) ) for him , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
marco do you think , um -- the -- when the republicans are campaigning -- they were saying that well , another attack on the u.s. is -- imminent , that it probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so far to say that if -- it 's really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they 're doing the best they can and -- i think kerry would do the best he could . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but do you think , um -- that -- and this is n't quite a political issue , but do you think that -- there 's going to be another attack on the ~us ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
uh like in the next five years ? |||O O O O O O O O 
something big like -- the world ( ( ) ) |||O O O O O O O O O O 
derek i , i do n't know what your beliefs are , as far as , uh -- biblically or spiritually or whatever , but -- i believe it 's inevitable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , we 're going down , you know ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , yeah , and this is , all these things have been written about actually . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
derek um -- the tw - the uh -- what is it , the towers , uh -- that was actually uh there 's references to that in the bible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i 've heard , i 've heard about that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
10 . death of arafat ( 2 ) plo leader plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something malicious ( like poisoning ) ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
what do you think of israel 's policies surrounding arafat 's illness and death ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
should president bush or a senior us official have attended arafat 's funeral ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
should israel have let arafat be buried in jerusalem ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , hi , yeah , this is james . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well , what do you think ? |||O O O O O O O 
i think i was on this one yesterday , same subject . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james i , i believe i 've talked about this subject once before too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , well , let 's see , my past views were , uh -- illness - wise , ah -- i do n't think -- it helped him , being in the compound . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 're , you know , you 're never going to know if there was any , ah , clandestine - type operation that -- aided his , ah -- ah , illness . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that they , ah , ( ( ) ) , i do n't think you 're ever going to find out if there was any direct |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed but i do n't , you know , from just the generic point , or general point of view , it did n't help his illness once he got -- sick -- being in the compound , closed in like that with the arabs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james i do n't -- i do n't know if i think there was something -- you know , malicious done , because , you know , looking back -- he 's been had this shaking thing going on |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james for quite some time . |||O O O O O O 
and i agree that the surroundings could n't have helped . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
james yeah , it , it could 've only exacerbated , uh , his situation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because for -- for a good little while now i 've noticed , you know , that his lips would tremble , and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james and , you know , it 's like , um , uh , almost like he had , uh , what is that , parkinson 's ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , something like that , but , uh , i do n't know what the exact conditions were -- in that compound , but they could n't have been could n't have been , ah , conducive to someone of his age -- and of his health -- and as far as , as , ah , the united states sending a senior ~ us official , i think they should 've sent someone -- i do n't know how senior that person had to be . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , uh , it could 've been a gesture |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well they did -- they did send somebody , i thought . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
did n't they go with a senior official , i had |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed did n't think they were going to ask this question , but i |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james oh y - yeah , you 're right , they did send someone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed but it was n't -- like , ah , was n't bush , i definitely would n't send him , i do n't think you want to have him in that part of the world right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed regardless of what you think about him , he 's , ah |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james yeah , i do n't think he should have went -- as a matter of fact , i do n't think any senior official should 've went , i do n't think -- secretary of state colin powell should have went . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , whoever they sent was , was good enough . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
james yeah , was good enough , just to show -- the palestinian people -- that , uh you know , america does care somewhat -- that you 've lost your leader . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
but , uh , no , it would 've been -- it would 've been a wro - as a matter of fact , i think sending bush would have made it worse . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , because he 's not liked that much by the palestinian people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i , i do n't think sending him would 've been -- would 've been the right thing to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , i agree with that . |||O O O O O O O 
james yeah , i do n't think it would 've added anything to -- to the situation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and possibly could 've made it worse . |||O O O O O O O O 
as to -- his burial |||O O O O O 
ed ah , not anymore , these are all , uh like these are all political responses |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed you know , there is no right answer , considering that that is not |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed you know , they 're still arguing over -- that land , and is it , ah |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed who owns it and respect , so i mean it 's |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'd say my overall opinion is that -- this conflict is way past that time . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
you know , it 's been going on for all these many -- what , |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
james hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives , and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they 've ever known -- on both sides israeli and palestinian , all they 've ever known is war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i mean , that 's , that 's my , my view , this thing has gone so long -- like you said , about a piece of land . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and it 's just , you know , they , they , they got to learn at some point -- that they 're going to have to be able to get along . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
or this is just going to keep going around , and around , and around , and , you know , the the -- the palestinians will , will , will -- will -- will do something , then israel will respond , and then back and forth -- and it 's just like a never ending circle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O 
and , like i said , i 'm personally just tired of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think the world is just tired of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and they need to try and , try and , i , i mean , i do n't have the answer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , i do n't have all the answers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i just know that it is just -- just an ongoing situation that is - there seems to be -- no end in sight . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
10 . death of arafat ( 2 ) plo leader plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something malicious ( like poisoning ) ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
what do you think of israel 's policies surrounding arafat 's illness and death ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
should president bush or a senior us official have attended arafat 's funeral ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
should israel have let arafat be buried in jerusalem ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
mike hi , this is mike . |||O O O O O O O 
paul nice to meet you , mike . |||O O O O O O O O 
mike yeah , nice to meet you . |||O O O O O O O O 
paul uh , well , pretty complicated -- topic . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you think it was poison ? |||O O O O O O 
paul well -- ( ( smoosh ) ) no , i i heard that just a couple of days ago and -- i i kind of doubt it or at least i hope not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i guess that 's what it is . |||O O O O O O O O 
mike yeah , i do n't think he was poisoned . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i think he was just fr - frail and i think he 'd been uh , he 'd been looking frail and he was shaky . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , he 'd been looking h - like he was shaking and , uh , seeming frail . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for some time when i 'd see him in public , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike presentation -- so forth . |||O O O O O O 
and i think it whatever it was , it got him , just caught up with him and and he reached the you know , the end of his time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , that 's about it on that , i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i i guess now that that he 's he 's died -- it 'll be , uh , or it it should be a change for the ~ plo |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike well , yeah , it 'll be change . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i i do n't know if it 'll move forward any better -- but , uh , this , uh , i 've heard our administration thinks it will . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think he was a block to the peace -- but i think it 's not only his doing , it 's also the -- you know , the , uh , more , uh , drastic elements of the ~ plo that , uh , that , uh , would n't allow him to pursue peace |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul well , i 'm -- i 'm -- i do n't know , uh . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he he seems like a guy who is much more comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peace settlements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
mike well , you know , he was kind of damned if he did and damned if he did n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would 've killed him -- and if he did n't make peace , eh , then he 's considered , you know , the the warmongering , uh , man who wo n't make peace , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , he , uh , he could n't really win . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think he could make peace . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know if anyone else can , either . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul yeah , i guess that 's the big question , if someone moderate takes over and they reach a settlement , does that mean the ~ plo will split ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean that -- that could be just -- dangerous . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul i guess , uh , making peace with half of the palestinians is better than nothing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of the other questions it asked us was , did we think our president and our , uh , you know , officials should 've attended his funeral . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what do you think about that ? |||O O O O O O O 
well , i i do n't remember who they sent , but they did send over some very -- low level state department person |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
mike i did n't know that . |||O O O O O O O 
paul i i -- i was kind of embarrassed about that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that we did or d - that we did not send our officials . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul i mean -- we -- we did , but i - it was some -- it was a nobody , basically . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so you were embarrassed because you thought they should 've sent someone higher up ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul i i -- i mean , for for the funeral ceremony in , uh , egypt . ( ( i mean ) ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike yeah , i think so , too . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i think they should 've sent someone higher up . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
and , uh , i i can understand that they would n't want to send anybody |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do n't forget this was the this was the representative of a whole people , you know what i mean ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the past he was their main representative and , uh , just out of respect for the people we should 've sent someone i think . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i think it would 've been a much more positive message . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike i think it would 've , uh , you know , been a -- a step toward , um , you know , gaining the , uh , i do n't know , the respect and and the , um , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike uh , th - of the people that we 're going to have to be working with to try to bring about a peace , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul that ( ( yeah , ) ) it -- yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike and , uh , it would 've -- gone an - a little farther to encourage them to , you know , be willing to sit down at the table with us , at least , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , i mean not that it would 've even been noticed -- in that regard had he -- had had our president or someone higher gone , but the fact that they did n't , that 's what 's really going to be noticed , you know what i mean ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , uh , you know , colin powell is a -- pretty moderate guy and would 've been nice to see him there or maybe -- the , uh , deputy -- secret of state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not even sure who that is . |||O O O O O O O O O 
eh , somebody will -- or higher up . |||O O O O O O O O O 
mike yeah , someone m - a little more , uh |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , it did n't seem quite appropriate . |||O O O O O O O O O 
paul but , uh , at at least for the ceremony in egypt i think , uh , i can understand that no one would want to go into -- palestinian territory . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
i mean , they it was total chaos there . |||O O O O O O O O O O

should israel have let arafat be buried in jerusalem ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
marco hello , th - i 'm marco from illinois . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
hi , i 'm mike from new jersey . |||O O O O O O O O O 
how are you doing , mike ? |||O O O O O O O 
so - so what do you think ? |||O O O O O O O O 
marco yeah , okay , um , ( ( lot of question ) ) -- and , um , i - i do n't think it was poisoning , even though i have n't read -- a lot of articles about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike he - he was old . |||O O O O O O O 
marco y - he was old , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and - -- and that - i - i did n't realize he was n't allowed to be buried in jerusalem , which - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike yeah , but a lot of that has to do with things that he 's done . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's - i mean , like , you know , let 's - i - -- for - for all he did in his later years , eh , yasser arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk of al - you know , a lot of -- israeli dying -- i - you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
he basically , eh , i - i 'm completely torn on the whole thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , on one hand -- i think it was kind of wrong that -- that -- you know , the ~ un just kind of went in and said , hey , you know , guess what ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , we 're - we 're you know , this is israel now , state of israel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and basically what they did was they carved up the region and - -- without any regard to , you know , tribal -- animosity really , is really what it boils down to , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , then it th - it was there , he had to try to maintain the status quo -- but they bred -- people like yasser arafat , i mean , if it -- if it was n't for the stupidity of the united nations , people like yasser yara - arafat w - probably would 've never even gotten off the ground , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how how did the united nations , uh , arafat in power , or help ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike well , in other words eh , in other -- when -- after world war two when they when -- basically the state of israel was formed |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike in f - uh , nineteen forty eight , i think it was . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , you know , you - e - -- granted , you know , there were there were jewish people already living there , but -- all the jewish people started going there and they j - basically just - you know , they just took over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike in in a region where , uh , you know , y - you know , we live in america . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's like coup - you know , f - our country 's a couple hundred years old , we got a couple of gripes going back to , you know , what , seventeen seventy six , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike there it goes , you know , thous - it 's like the hatfields and the mccoys . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're fi - they do n't even know why they 're fighting anymore . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
they just they hate each other -- and they 're always going to hate each other -- and it does n't matter who started it , but -- i - you know , somebody eh , th - somebody 's in always intent on winning . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and it 's and it 's it 's you know , a war of attrition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
it 's either , you know , you may kill me , but i 'm going to kill all of you before - y - you know what i mean ? |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's just i - i - it 's stupid . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and a guy like yasser arafat , |||O O O O O O O 
mike he was a terrorist . |||O O O O O O 
in in the sixties -- in the mid sixties an - and and a - you know , on into - -- you know , through the mid eighties -- the guy was a terrorist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , let us let us not forget that when israel was -- formed -- and they were , um , the -- the israelis for not feeling -- like they had a legitimate -- right -- some of the land or that -- land was n't , um , rightfully theirs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there were -- two very strong -- militant groups that were israeli and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
mike oh , the yeah , the zionists . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so , i mean , i - -- you know , uh , how we consider -- arafat a terrorist , we also should consider that -- could 've been , in some ways , a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed by the israelis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not believe me , i 'm not i 'm not excusing -- anybody -- but for the purpose i i mean , the way i see it is you know , i guess for the purposes of the conversation th - -- that they want to hear , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike y - you got to kind of have to put that as y - -- i - it 's kind of like -- do if that 's the case , do two wrongs really make a right ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know what i mean ? |||O O O O O O 
but if arafat had n't been i do n't know if he 's -- directly -- been linked to hamas ' acts , uh , but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation having to negotiate -- the militants of -- palestine -- the international leaders -- and if it if hara - arafat had n't -- somehow appeased -- the hamas groups or the palestinian militants , then -- he would 've been kicked out , overthrown -- by - -- by the palestinians . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
oh , forget about kicked out or overthrown , he would 've been killed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
that 's - that 's how it works over there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , it it 's not really arafat -- as an individual , i think it 's just -- whatever leader -- is -- placed in the position of - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was he was basically -- i mean , i 've read i 've read articles an - and - and - and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the munich -- massacre -- th - you know , the munich olympic massacre th - the is - the israeli team . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it - -- the the problem is -- what he did -- back way back when |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mike will -- f - forever tarnish anything that he did -- in his later years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
like like you said , bringing the groups together but the reason that he was able to bring them together is because he was once one of them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
10 . death of arafat ( 2 ) plo leader plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
what do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something malicious ( like poisoning ) ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what do you think of israel 's policies surrounding arafat 's illness and death ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
should president bush or a senior us official have attended arafat 's funeral ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
should israel have let arafat be buried in jerusalem ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
joe hello , my name is joe . |||O O O O O O O O 
james i 'm james from detroit . |||O O O O O O O 
joe uh , from , uh , new jersey , but i 'm living in atlanta now , going to college . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , uh , what do you think about arafat ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well -- i , uh , i do n't think there was anything malicious , uh , in terms of his death -- uh , just looking at him these last , uh , couple of years uh , it seems like he had alzheimer 's or something . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe yeah , he has been getting older . |||O O O O O O O O O 
james yeah , because he was quivering at the mouth and and hands were shaking . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would imagine that living in that compound could n't have been that conducive to his health . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe yeah , he probably should have been in a hospital or a hospice or |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe you know , if it was that bad . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
right , i 'm sure that they , i do n't know about , bout -- the uh sanitary conditions there , but -- i i just do n't think it could have been , uh , conducive to his health . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and as far as , uh , israel , uh , allowing -- him to be buried -- uh , in jerusalem |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james well , it , it 's acceptable to me , but i do n't think it was feasible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james yeah , given the circumstance in that area right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't even know if they would have been able to pull it off , you know ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe well , uh , so he , in fact he was n't |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe so , um -- no , so he was n't buried in jerusalem . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , they buried him -- uh , inside that compound . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james yeah , they buried him inside that compound . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
but like you say , i do n't , i do n't -- i personally -- uh -- would n't have seen a problem with it , but -- i just do n't think it was feasible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't , i do n't think that they would have been -- uh , secure enough to really do it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think either side would have really -- let it happen -- and -- and as far as a senior u.s. official going , i do n't think that would have been necessary either . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , i know president bush should n't have went -- and he was n't going . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe well , i kind of feel , i kind of feel another way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think a senior u.s. service in there , should have been there , because i mean -- he , arafat 's been -- been the one coming to all these peace talks , you know , with president clinton and , you know , other |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe other um -- litigations towards that . |||O O O O O O O O 
you know , i think , i think we could have just showed our face and said you know , yeah , we do recognize this man . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well it , they sent someone . |||O O O O O O O 
i do n't know who it was -- ( ( it was n't ) ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it probably , it was n't anybody important . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it was just like a |||O O O O O 
james yeah it was an under secretary , there 's no doubt about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james there was no senior u.s. official there . |||O O O O O O O O O 
there 's there 's no question about that . |||O O O O O O O O O 
james but , uh -- you know , uh , bush 's policy -- towards , uh , yasser arafat has been hands off |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james from from the beginning cause i do n't , i do n't think he ever even met with him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe i do n't think so . |||O O O O O O O 
joe bush is kind of like , staying away from the whole israel -- palestinian |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now on his part i think that was a mistake . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
james yeah , you know you got to engage people in some type of dialogue |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe to me , the talk , the peace talks should have continued -- after clinton 's administration left . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe cause at the cause at the end clinton was doing all this peace talk with arafat and , um |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe ( ( forget ) ) the um , prime minister in israel , but he was talking to him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they were doing all these talks in camp david and and it should have just continued when br - bush came into office . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
like i said , i think that was one of bush 's biggest mistakes , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james not continuing -- the talks . |||O O O O O O O 
because clinton had came so very close |||O O O O O O O 
james to to maybe getting some type of agreement |||O O O O O O O O O 
james but , uh , bush just took a hands off approach . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he just -- kind of took a hands off approach . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now the situation in , you know , jerusalem and the west bank is just -- escalated . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i think too -- israel 's -- position toward arafat -- in terms of keeping him sort of like -- uh -- surrounded in that compound -- i do n't think that was a good idea . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , because that , you ca n't pick a leader for a people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
whether you like them or not -- people get to choose who they want to follow , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james and the palestinians had made it clear -- that arafat was their leader . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , i think that they , we should have found a way -- israel should have found a way -- to -- keep some type of dialogue -- going along . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
cause uh , i mean , you look at what 's going on now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
james i mean , their policy toward him did n't get them anything . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then you got suicide bombing on the one side , and then you got israel -- you know , it 's like one day , you 'll he - a bomb will go off , the next day israel will do and air strike and -- you know , it 's like going around in a circle . |||O O O O B-TRI B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's like going around in a circle . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's really a bad situation . |||O O O O O O O 
it is , and it 's , it 's been so long -- going on , i mean , you 're talking about something that 's been going on historically for hundreds of years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe hundreds of years and then , it just recently really come into spectrum , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe what , nineteen forty nine ? |||O O O O O O O 
joe when um -- the israel state -- came into being , or whatever . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the holiday season is right around the corner . |||O O O O O O O O O 
who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you go to a lot of parties with friends , neighbors , co-workers or family members ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are there people you see during the holidays that you do n't see during the rest of the year ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you travel to meet up with family or friends during the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
where do you go and who do you visit ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
hi this is ed. good . |||O O O O O O 
how are you doing jane ? |||O O O O O O 
if you hear noise in the background , i 'm enjoying the holiday season walking in new york city , so |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed ( ( city ) ) -- ( ( trusts of life ) ) -- crazy people and , uh , other things going on but that 's new york , what can you say . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
used to live in new york . |||O O O O O O O 
my brother - in - law still lives in the city but we were long island people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , so what are you doing for the festive holidays . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , it 's really bad because i still really do n't know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm up in the air with about six different clients trying to decide what we 're going to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that means that you 've got a lot of people to see and do things with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jane yeah , makes it kind of hectic . |||O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , we 're going to be doing , uh , the typical . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
go up and celebrate with the family and -- be with the little kids . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , the ( ( tough years ) ) and that which makes it -- because when you get older it 's kind of , i 've got all the gifts , i do n't need that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what i really want to do is see somebody else enjoy it and the little kids enjoy it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so - -- and , uh , do a lot of parties with family -- and friends . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jane well , that 's kind of where - we 're in between which family we 're going to see and when and how and get all that worked out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed so whoev - yeah , i 've seen them - -- just not the gifts it comes down to the food . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i - one of these choices is meat cooking . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll have to put that towards the end. |||O O O O O O O O O 
ed my family 's , uh , parents are deceased and most of ( ( them ) ) is , uh , passed my brothers all over , so her family 's still younger -- and , uh , you know , just the odd sides . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she 's the oldest and i 'm the youngest , so she 's got younger which -- keeps the thing going , so i - -- you know , my view is -- ( ( stay ) ) with the family go visit the family . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so -- keep it together through thick and thin and -- when it comes to thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
and then there 's little parties . |||O O O O O O O 
big - uh , her sister does a big family party -- but try to keep that same |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed local family coming together . |||O O O O O O 
it 's amazing how they can get into little squabbles and who does n't show up |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they used to always really all get together . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but his parents uh they actually live next door to us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but they 're starting to get up in the years , so they 're not , you know , hosting the big parties , so it 's funny how now people do n't all bother to come |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jane and you kind of wonder you know in the next couple of years what 's all going to happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are they all going to see each other . |||O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , no that 's - that 's exactly . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've already seen , you know , ( ( in ) ) my parents ( ( ' bed ) ) until they ( ( got ) ) less and less that the brothers got together -- and then now when there 's an event you try to do it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at christmas it 's just impossible because we leave -- two days after christmas |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed to go out of the country as part of our new year 's |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , for us it 's , you know , got to be a quick trip up |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed to her family and then back where we - -- we 've been invited to be down in |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if a person is not - even though it 's cold up in the northeast , it 's a family tradition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i should do it -- and less for the gifts and more for |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jane well , we did - -- - for the kids you know we made it pretty cl - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed i do n't know , i think that 's great . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jane - you know , you did n't have all the hassle of running around and being crazy and just kind of spent time together |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed and i think that 's very - i mean , if - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jane and it was really pretty nice . |||O O O O O O O O 
ed yeah , we have n't - -- yeah , i think -- e - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
e - eventually that may happen , the way we 're going with , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed my wife and i with her |||O O O O O O O 
not as a negative but as a - |||O O O O O O O O 
ed you know , we do a lot of traveling so that 's going to be - i think that 's going to come up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but - -- but for now we 're still trying to do - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed as long as the mother 's around , we 'll still do christmas and act as - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed she is not really old , but she 's getting older , so i think that 's one reason to stay together |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed and also i think i - is |||O O O O O O O O 
ed eh , we - we kind of -- infused a little family party that her sister has so -- i think if we were to go away both of those might fall off a little bit and it does n't take but one year and then all of the sudden everybody 's |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ed not coming to it anymore and it 's like a - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's the way it is . |||O O O O O O O 
ed yeah , but not because - |||O O O O O O O 
ed it is - -- i - i enjoy the -- smiling people and the festive - -- festive nature and -- i think it does get a little commercialized . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( ( it 's not that the - ) ) -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can ignore that part of it , i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the holiday season is right around the corner . |||O O O O O O O O O 
who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you go to a lot of parties with friends , neighbors , co-workers or family members ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are there people you see during the holidays that you do n't see during the rest of the year ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you travel to meet up with family or friends during the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
where do you go and who do you visit ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
britt hi , my name 's britt . |||O O O O O O O O 
basically , i -- spend a lot of time with my family . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carol i usually go to , um , maybe two christmas parties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one at my office and one at a friend 's house . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that includes family and friends . |||O O O O O O 
um , and that 's basically it . |||O O O O O O O O 
we do n't usually do too much -- other than that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so most of your family is locate - where , where are you ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , so most of your family is located in your area , then ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most of my family has -- moved on . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so , i do n't -- usually get to have the big family , um , holidays . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carol well , we do that on christmas eve. |||O O O O O O O O O 
britt yeah , i out we always , in my family we always did presents and everything christmas -- day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
britt i know a lot of people |||O O O O O O O 
carol we do it christmas eve . |||O O O O O O O 
britt do it on christmas eve . yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so i do n't know where that tradition started in my family but that -- we 've always done it that way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um . but yeah , my family 's all over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
my mom 's -- parents are in florida , and i have aunts and uncles in virginia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah it is hard to get together then . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we saw a bunch of people for thanksgiving , but um , i only have |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
britt one uncle that 's in state , and then |||O O O O O O O O O O 
carol where do you , uh bost - massachusetts ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
britt my dad 's -- yes . |||O O O O O O O 
britt yeah , and then my , my father 's family are all overseas , so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
britt uh , yeah , so , we do n't often get to see sometimes people i mean , my aunt came for christmas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you have any children ? |||O O O O O O 
britt yeah , i 'm alm - i 'm twenty - seven . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not quite there yet . |||O O O O O O O 
but um , actually , this year i - we 're going -- uh |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my parents are also divorced , so it was always difficult because we had to , like , split christmas . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so we would do , like , new years with - i mean , um , christmas eve with one set of , you know , parents , and then christmas day with the other . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , yeah , it was always tough , so we never really went anywhere . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , this year is , like , all the children are old enough now that we do n't have to split christmas , so - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're actually , um , going to france for christmas to have with my aunt , so - |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how long will you be out there ? |||O O O O O O O O 
i 'm leaving on monday and coming back on the thirtieth , so um , |||O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
britt yeah , it 's the first vacation i 've had all year pretty much , so , so yeah , i 'm very much looking forward to it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh , have a great time . |||O O O O O O O 
so it 's going to be a little different -- this year especially , because it 's -- going to be a lot of people - some people i do n't even know , and um - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , but a beautiful country . |||O O O O O O O 
carol mhm , good for you . |||O O O O O O O 
although , this year everything 's been so crazy a - at , at my office that they decided to have the holiday party in january . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what type of work do you do ? |||O O O O O O O O 
um , i work for a transportation planning consulting firm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it takes a while to explain , too , it 's just kind of like - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carol sounds kind of crazy . |||O O O O O O 
britt yeah , it 's , eh , we 're not -- an architecture firm or a , or a construction firm , and were not engineering either . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
britt so the work that comes -- beforehand . |||O O O O O O O O O 
britt you know , um , i do n't know , say new jersey transit authority comes to us and says , we want a , you know - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carol well , i 'm a teacher . |||O O O O O O O O 
what -- what do you teach ? |||O O O O O O O 
uh , i teach adult high school right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm retired from full - time teaching , |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
carol but i teach adult high school , so i teach careers and history -- three night s a week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then i usually sub during the day -- or watch children . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i really enjoy it -- a lot . |||O O O O O O O O 
britt i always wanted to be teacher . |||O O O O O O O O 
my parents kind of talked me out of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
carol i talked my daughter out of it . |||O O O O O O O O O 
no , i would n't recommend anyone going into teaching now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would not rec - as a matter of fact i do n't recommend it |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , when i was - i wanted to be a music teacher and that would 've been even harder |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
britt i think because the - one , you get laid off first pr - you know , first person to get laid off is going to be the arts and |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
and that 's what ha - what is happening . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
britt which makes me so upset . |||O O O O O O O 
oh , i c - it drives my crazy , like , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
britt i - you know , art and music are so |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
britt so important to your culture and , you know , wh - having be a well rounded person . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , you ca n't do it , at least you could try , you know , and you - i just - -- not everything can be academic , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the holiday season is right around the corner . |||O O O O O O O O O 
who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you go to a lot of parties with friends , neighbors , co-workers or family members ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are there people you see during the holidays that you do n't see during the rest of the year ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you travel to meet up with family or friends during the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
where do you go and who do you visit ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
deirdre my name is deirdre . |||O O O O O O 
so , what do you do for the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
do you celebrate the holidays ? |||O O O O O O 
is it religious for you , or just the holiday season ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , christmas , not hanukkah or anything like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh - huh , so yo - you have a church service ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , actually , usually we 're out of town so we do n't attend our church . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
so you go with , um , family , friends ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's almost always my grandma . |||O O O O O O O 
deirdre your gran - you go to your grandma 's house . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
deirdre yeah , that 's what we do . |||O O O O O O O O O 
every year , uh , but i do n't always attend . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , my family -- celebrates the sun shining . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
so , uh , it 's not particularly special at christmas -- because they see each other every other weekend . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , still , uh , they go to , uh , grandmother 's -- every christmas . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
a particular person 's house every holiday season . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you know , whether it 's christmas or -- thanksgiving or mother 's day or easter , it just alternates it - you know , each - uh , a particular person 's house is - is how they do it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i just do n't always attend . |||O O O O O O O 
i do n't know , it 's - -- there 's just so much of my family i can take during one year , you know , but - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , um , since they see each other so much , is there anything that does make it special ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i guess they seem to think it 's just special because -- everyone comes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i - i - it 's - -- it 's just , i do n't know , old . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
y - you know , it 's - it 's not - -- it 's not special to me because they do it all the time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , special would make it , i only see you once a year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's just not - it 's just not special if i see you every other month . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , it 's just not . |||O O O O O O O O 
i mean , you know , not like , you 're seeing your mother -- or your sister , maybe your brothers , you know , you - you might - you may see them all the time , but when you see your aunts and uncles and all your cousins -- all the time , where 's the break here ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , you know , they like - i do n't particularly care for it , but they like it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did attend thanksgiving and |||O O O O O 
um , uh , it was - it was a good day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , but , you know , we - we -- spend all day together . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's not like you just go and eat dinner a couple of hours and go home . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
you go and you stay twelve hours -- because most of my relatives live within thirty minutes of each other , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's easy just to go to someone 's house . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , sounds a lot like my mom 's side of the family because they 're all in one city except for |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ryan except for her and , uh , us . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well , would you rather be with everyone else or do you like it -- away . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ryan i think i would rather be , but then again -- i talk to my cousin and i 'm always asking her how my other cousins are doing and -- she hardly knows because she has - hardly sees them every day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i do n't think it 'd make a big difference . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't ( ( see them or - ) ) you know , by choice and , you know , relatives -- are particular people , you know , but not particular , peculiar people , let 's put it that way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's just -- funny to me who you end up with , you know , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
deirdre as your relative , you know . |||O O O O O O O O 
you think , eh , you are my rela - you got to be kidding me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wh - -- what happened here but , uh , it 's fun , uh . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , i 'm not so big on christi - i mean , i was - i was raised christian , uh , but , uh , and i did n't put too much , you know , in my house with my kids -- but my daught -, she 's just -- you know , she get 's into it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she 's gets into the holiday spirit and wants every light , you know , in the city on our house and , you know , tree in her room , that kind of thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , i - i indulge her , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i do n't really get too much into it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , the - -- all the , um , trimmings , i suppose , of the holiday season . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , but i like , you know , gift giving and -- just , uh , sharing things and just having fun . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just , uh , just do n't over do it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i would prefer , though , um , a service , a spiritual service -- to uh , family 's just always together , they 're always together . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now if there was a spiritual service then , yeah , see that would be really special to me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if everybody - now wh - eh , eh , now years ago , and of course i 'm not giving away my age but trust me , i 'm older , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
deirdre eh , i used to , um , celebrate it with my grandmother -- and we 'd always have a midnight service at church . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gosh that was so many years a - |||O O O O O O O O 
ryan wow , a midnight service , like , um , christmas eve ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

well , i know where they 're at , but i 'm not very close to that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no , i 'm in the northern part of the state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you all have a big christmas at your house ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
mildred we go to my niece 's house and |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O

i used to do that and now she 's took over , which i 'm so happy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , yeah quite a few . |||O O O O O O O 
my kids , uh , kids and their kids come , all but one of them . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
my son goes to his in - laws , but my two girls will come and |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O

mildred six of them was -- seven of them was girls , counting me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i only had one brother . |||O O O O O O 
so , they are spread out . |||O O O O O O O 
eve is the big day for - -- - but not christmas |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eve because we always got together on christmas eve . when i was little , we lived in wisconsin , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carrie and then when we moved to alabama there was n't a lot of family close by . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- for the holiday and it 's the only holiday that we actually all get together on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carrie -fourth of july , drop of a hat . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
so , i told him , i said , you know , if we can squeeze in running by christmas eve on the way to my parents ' , fine , but , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carrie you know , that 's it . |||O O O O O O O O 
anybody can come here christmas day that wants to . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
you know , we do n't -- my - my father - in - law - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carrie - and then if - -- if he wo n't , you know , eh , sometimes i cook a christmas dinner , sometimes i do n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just depends if my husband has to work or not , um , depends on what i 'm going to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , there 's a lot of us . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so , we get together like - |||O O O O O O O 
mildred - well , my sister usually comes in from ohio because it 's not that far like -- two hundred fifty miles or something , and she 'll come in for thanksgiving . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
and we all eat together which is real nice . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well , that is go -- that 's funny that you said that , two hundred and fifty miles not being far - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carrie - and she 's going to have to fly back to wisconsin , um - |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
mildred eh , that 's not too far to me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
mildred well , like , alabama from here , my sister 's is about six hundred miles from me , the one down there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , that 's a long ways to me . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
mildred but , uh , two hundred and fifty 's not too bad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carrie -i went to a place ca -- i want to say it was called stump town , |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
carrie or something like that , but , |||O O O O O O O O 
mildred never heard of it . |||O O O O O O 
carrie uh , it was a real small place . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it - they w - had to go up there about some natural gas rights or something like that . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you was in the country |||O O O O O 
yeah , you had to cross a little walking , swinging bridge to get to this man 's house , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O 
i did n't like that part . |||O O O O O O O 
the holiday season is right around the corner . |||O O O O O O O O O 
who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you go to a lot of parties with friends , neighbors , co-workers or family members ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are there people you see during the holidays that you do n't see during the rest of the year ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you travel to meet up with family or friends during the holidays ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
where do you go and who do you visit ? |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
this is judy from mayfield , kentucky . |||O O O O O O O O 
i think we may have talked before . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O 
judy i 've -- done so many , i do n't remember . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've talked to people from pennsylvania , yes . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
well , what - where - how far do you travel for your holiday ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , i travel on christmas day only about an hour and a half . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
go to tennessee to see my , uh , two sisters . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
my brother go - we go together . |||O O O O O O O O 
my brother , his wife , my husband and myself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
then you spend the day there ? |||O O O O O O O 
yes , and , uh , christmas eve we spend - my husband and i spend with my mother - in - law and her - and his family . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , pretty much , uh , um , n - m - we , uh , have - we have two adult children that have been married in the last two years , and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm just wondering just how long it 's going to be that the - -- they 're doing the , um , you know , his parents her parents , uh , christmas trips , but sounds like you 've been doing that for a while . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well my mom and dad are dead . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i 'm fifty - one , and both of my parents have been dead a while . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
and , um , i do n't - -- i have n't been really - well , i 've had chronic fatigue syndrome real bad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , um , and i 'm not able to get out much . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so that 's why my brother and his wife are coming to get us on christmas day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , uh , no , um -- part of our family 's sort of been estranged , so to speak . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it 'll be very interesting . |||O O O O O O O 
my brother and i are real close , and my sister |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
judy that -- lives away from here in arkansas -- are real close , but the two sisters from tennessee , we 're not real close . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , this is not something that -- is a regular tradition ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
judy uh , this is going to be a new one , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
judy going to tennessee , and the regular tradition is going to my mother - in - law 's . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , eh , we 're setting up tradition . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i really hope that , uh , that it - it 's a good one , and that you have a |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , now , uh , di - but we are going to set this up as a tradition to meet at this one sister 's house in tennessee . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , yeah and thi - and we 're not doing gifts this year , but next year we 're going to give - draw names . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , there , that 's a tradition that 's going to be set up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i do n't go to a lot of parties , and i 'm not able to go to church , so -- the party they would have there i , you know , i 'm not doing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i 'm not able to do , uh , much . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , we do n't , you know , and i ne - never was a , you know , i mean , i do n't , i do n't like going up to jo - a whole bunch of parties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , we 're not much party people , either . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , we have , uh , some family very - |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
my husband 's , uh , brother and his family -- live in the same town . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , we have , uh , one of our married children in the same town up here , and one of them down in south carolina . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , so it 'll be nice . |||O O O O O O O O 
they 'll be coming up for christmas , and so we 'll have - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how old are your children ? |||O O O O O O 
my oldest is , uh , twenty - five , and , uh , the next one 's twenty - three , and -- i 've got a twenty year old and a sixteen year old |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have a twenty - eight year old son and a twenty - two year old daughter , and neither one of them lives at home . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
okay , so are they -- close by , or ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , my daughter is in louisville , clear across the state , and she 's not coming home . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and , uh , but , uh , you know , it 's really -- for the good for because of the kind of life she 's living right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
judy yeah , it 's a h - -- it 's a han - she 's a - she can be a handful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , uh , yeah , we 'll - we 'll make it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my son 's going to be moving back home next year , and he 's a joy . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's going to go into the , uh - he 's going to be a pastor and a counselor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
judy i 'm just not able to work right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's wha - it 's more than fatigue . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a whole group of things , and it - and you run a lot of fever . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when you get in the severe stage , you know , you get out once a week and do what you have to do - because my husband does n't drive , because of coordination problems from a head injury - -- and that puts you out for the rest of the week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , you have a lot to deal with . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i have a lot of faith in god , so that works . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that works with my holidays , too . |||O O O O O O O O 
war in iraq the us is currently engaged in major fighting in fallujah , iraq . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
much of the country is unstable , but national elections are still scheduled to take place in iraq in january . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think the us is doing the right thing in iraq ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if not , what should we be doing intstead ? |||O O O O O O O O O O

well , i do n't blame you . |||O O O O O O O O 
i -- like i said , you know , most of my family is |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b military and , uh , you know , it 's funny because my husband was in the marines and he 's all , you know , well , you know , they 're over there doing a duty . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but my dad was in the army and he was in vietnam war and he 's like , this is crazy , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush is an idiot , you know . |||O O O O O O O O 
and , um , i mean , i agree with my dad and , you know , if anybody should know it 's someone that fought in a war , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O 
exactly , they would definitely know . |||O O O O O O O 
well , you he - you hear these people saying that , i mean , that are in the mili - military you - you -- that it sa - you - some people who have come back home already and everything that they do n't agree with the whole thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , it 's -- that 's - that 's pretty -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b and he - -- that 's bad when , you know - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a that 's bad when they were there and were - and were living and they do n't agree with it , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , my dad said basically it 's for the money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was for the money . |||O O O O O O 
and and and to me , to let people die because so your friends |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
b you know your politician friends and whoever other friends can make more money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how much more money do they need ? |||O O O O O O O O 
a exact - they 're -- greedy . |||O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i mean , and and here are these military guys giving their lives , and working hard every day through training and stuff even if there is n't a war , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
b and you 're paying them piss -- because i do n't know if you watch the news a lot , but , uh , like , last summer they showed military people standing on lines for , like , getting food and stuff that they do n't get paid enough -- to where - |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
a yeah , they said that there were some -- yeah , i s - i saw a story about that where they - where they 're - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , it was , like , on twenty twenty or something . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , they 're - where they 're coming home from the war and they -- yeah , they 're - they 're pretty much homeless and - and ha - they have nothing . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , so what the hell is going on ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , you 're sending these guys over there and you want them to be at peace of mind , you know , they - you want them to be able to fight , you know , |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
a that 's - -- eh , yeah . |||O O O O O O O O O 
b and to be able to save their lives and they 're worried about their families . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , that 's just -- |||O O O O O O O 
a yeah , and they c - the come home to nothing after g - all they 've gone through they come home and they have nothing . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
b you ca n't do that . |||O O O O O O O 
a that 's just -- eh , that 's just pathetic . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's what -- you know , that 's what people need to , you know , speak up about and nobody - nobody ever does . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and - and it 's like a , you know , i do n't know if you remember , but it was like |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b right -- a little bit right after the war started in iraq there was a soldier that spoke out and he got reprimanded for it . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yes , i do remember that . |||O O O O O O O O 
yes , he got , um , he - well , one , uh -- somebody , like , left did n't they ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they just -- he was , like , one of the major - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , but this was another guy . |||O O O O O O O O O 
he just -- he repri - you know , he - he just , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a it was -- another guy . |||O O O O O O O 
b uh , spoke out against the war publicly and he got reprimanded for it |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
b and it 's supposed to be a big no - no . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , you know what , they have every right , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , it 's freedom of speech . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , we used to have to right to say what you - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , we 're over there supposedly helping iraq , and i do n't think those people care either -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a no , i do n't think they - |||O O O O O O O O O 
b i mean , uh , some of them do -- but then most of the idiots are the ones that are causing these problems . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if it was -- -- if it -- if they thought that it was such a great thing , then why are n't the people helping us ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b me as a person , if some - if someone came over and was helping me , me as a person whether i was in the military or not , i would be helping and i 'd be going around saying , look idiots , stop bomb - you know , i jus - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b uh , instead of -- it - it seems like every time they do a news report there is even the average m - joe schmo over there is complaining , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a e - exactly , and it - it just makes you wonder h - eh , what really is , i mean , what is it really like in there ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
why are n't they -- why are n't they coming to er - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b yeah , and if they 're not going to be grateful , then what the hell . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what the hell are we doing over there ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , wh - they - why are n't they appreciating us a little more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
exactly , because they really do n't . |||O O O O O O O O 
i mean , they look at us as -- the parties that are causing problems , look at us as we 're very corrupt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you have to remember , religion - wise , |||O O O O O O O O O 
what - they way we live is just -- totally against they 're religion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that 's , eh , they - the way they live is just so weird anyways , you know , it 's just - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , but they think of us as weird . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , so , you just , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O 
b everybody 's got their own way of , you know , thinking and - and they do n't want -- the biggest problem is - is -- we 're pushing ourselves on them , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're not pushing their religion on us . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you know , and so -- i - i guess -- i would have a problem if someone was shoving something down my throat , you know , saying , this is how it should be . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and - and that 's -- and that 's how we 're - we are . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're going over there , we 're saying , look , this is how we do it -- and , um , i - -- so we think everybody else should be that way . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a d- do you know much about the -- what - what is the elections going on in january ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

b i - i really had n't paid attention . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i know that it 's supposed to go on . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
b um , one of the other countries , i ca n't think of the name , tried doing it and then it was a big -- they had a big -- problem because they said it was a , um , that it - -- the guy should n't have won . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i forget which country that was . |||O O O O O O O

joe he did n't get his papers where he 's going to be c - -- he 's in upstate new york right now but he 's going to -- have to probably go back to - to either iraq or af - afghanistan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
tom well , that 's not fair . |||O O O O O O O O 
i - i did n't know they could send them more than once . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
oh , well , there - there 're been people that have been -- i do n't know if you 've been watching sixty minutes , there was a story of this lady that was -- her -- -- she 's a , um , uh , what do you call it , um , uh , reservist |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe and she did her time back in the sixties and she 's like fifty something years old now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they 're going to call her to go . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you got to be -- -- huh . |||O O O O O O O O 
yeah , they do n't -- they do n't have , um -- see what happened with the , um , the volunteer army , they 're not getting enough people , so they 're thinking of maybe get - putting in a draft . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eh , she was ar - she was already -- in the service -- and they 're calling her back in ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe was in the service , she - -- yep , she did her time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she thought -- she 's still in -- actually she 's still in the service , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe but she did her time . |||O O O O O O O 
tom oh , oh , she 's still in the service . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so they might - she -- -- this is what the story was about -- and there 're some people that do n't want to go . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , so , but it 's - it 's kind of a scary thing and i do n't know if the united states is doing the right thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know , to tell you the truth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
tom i -- do n't think so . |||O O O O O O O O 
joe i - i kind of lean - |||O O O O O O O O 
tom uh , i think - -- i think bush -- is , uh , trying to -- -- you know , his his dad -- pulled everybody out when they just , uh , kicked -- people out of , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tom okay , he wants to make sure everything 's done over there before he comes back . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe yeah , he wants to finish the job that his father |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tom that 's what i think . |||O O O O O O O 
that 's why his father did n't want to invade iraq , because of all these problems they 're having now . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he knew that there was going to be -- look at all these insurgents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
look at what happened a couple days ago , they killed , um , like seventy people . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
they -- put a bomb right into where the -- the , uh , |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe ( ( ) ) guys where stationed there in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tom well , what 's the the the |||O O O O O O O O 
joe you know , i did n't en - vote for george bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know why - how he got elected , i mean , there 's a lot of people that did vote . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did n't either vote for him either time , |||O O O O O O O O O O 
joe well , but , i mean , you know , i do n't see what he 's doing , i mean , look all the people that are leaving his cabinet -- and their calling for , um , run - rumsfeld 's regigna - resignation and , uh , even john mccain , he 's a republican , he wants him -- -- he wants rumsfeld to get out of there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
tom have you noticed how many of his , uh , um , staff |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , look at colin powell , look at , uh , george |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uh , he 's had , uh , quite a few . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's had at least , at least eight at the - the last count i checked , probably more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the homeland security guy , um , |||O O O O O O O 
tom well , yeah , and and they named another one and he resigned . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O 
yeah , that guy bernard , uh , the guy that was new york mayor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
or , not the mayor the new york police department chief or whatever . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eh , he quit , or he resigned . |||O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O 
something about , um , he had a legal maze or something . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , it 's all -- you know , i i i do n't know if we 're doing the right thing because now look at iran , what are we going to be , uh , and he he 's talking about trying to invade iran now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O

much of the country is unstable , but national elections are still scheduled to take place in iraq in january . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think the us is doing the right thing in iraq ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if not , what should we be doing intstead ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think the elections scheduled for january will take place , and if not , then what ? |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hi , i 'm allan from ~la . |||O O O O O O O O 
um , yeah , ok - um , eh , uh , it was talking something about , uh , the war in iraq , um , i guess , yeah , it 's a good thing -- about the elections that are going on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
i just talked to somebody from ~ la a couple days ago about that on the -- survey line . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
allan you got the same topic or - |||O O O O O O O O 
a yeah , i thought it was the same topic . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
a do you think the elections are going to happen ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
do you think the elections are going to happen ? |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
allan yeah , i think the -- i think they 're still they 're going to go through even though , uh , even though , um , what 's it called , that you know of all the -- turmoil that 's happening there and all of the argu - you know , and all the -- killings and everything . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i think it 'll still go through , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the -- it 's democracy , you know , you have to fight for it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's not -- it does n't come easily , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , that 's why i think it will , too , because they - they pushed it in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , uh , excuse me , in afghanistan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they kept on scheduling them and they we 're saying , oh , no no no , you know . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , yeah , i think -- you know i think they should have continued to go through with it , and you know um -- if - if there is -- if there 's problems , you know , just -- still -- do n't , you know -- just ignore it , keep going , you know you ca n't -- stop , you know , if you already started something , you know , you should complete it , i think . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
allan i mean , if they leave -- if they leave , you know , if the - eh , let 's say they , you know , they just leave right now , you know , the the -- they ca n't , you know , i do n't think the -- the -- the occupants themselves regain control and , you know , and mo - and , you know , and -- put down the power and , you know , an - and control everything they can . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they just need they , you know , they need assistance and to get off -- get off , you know , on the right step . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think they 're going to need the military to be in there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and assist them with the elections and they need to complete the elections and all this . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
a yeah , um , yeah , i do n't know what the end game , per se , is going to be there , you know , because , eh , they - the problem is the - is the culture , you know , it 's -- pretty , uh , you know , it 's really almost like a modern day crusades , you know , and that 's - that 's kind of hard , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a lot of -- there 's a lot of embitterment that goes back generations and stuff , so , you know , we have -- i do n't know , i always think we have such a short mindset , uh , but they do n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , that 's why , uh , i - i do n't know i - |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's always going to be problems there , i just do n't -- i do n't know how long we should -- be in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , definitely to keep it stable . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i - -- eh , i just -- i - i think the situation could be handled better . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i - i thought it was a great idea fir - them going in there -- and doing what they did but , uh , they had a short window of opportunity to win over the people and it did n't happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know if that was just out of our control or - or what or if we could 've done a better job but , uh , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you support the -- do you - do you support the war ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
do you support the war ? |||O O O O B-TRI O 
yeah , i did at first i just - i just -- i -- do n't like the way it was managed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i think -- i think , uh , they did a great job up front , of course . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , they did militarily - wise , they did an excellent job but i think they 've done a poor job , you know , reconstructing and just controlling the situation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
allan yeah , i - i agree also . |||O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i - i mean , i - i did support the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i just think that when they went in there , you know they -- they just did n't -- you know , they did n't i - execute everything correctly , you know there was problems , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
allan and i think i mean , that that lead to it , but yeah , i mean they -- i mean eh you know you 're already in it , so you know , you should n't -- you ca n't just walk down and , you know , stop , you got to complete what you 're doing , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a but , they - they definitely need to take a back seat to some sort -- you know , some sort of iraqi government there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know they set up the council , uh , interim council , but that has n't gone , you know , perfe - smoothly . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
um , they still -- americans have been calling the shots . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , if they can just sort of make a -- be - get into more of a supportive role and , you know , flex their muscles when they need to and maybe that will help - help , uh , squall some of the vi - the violence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
eh , if they could 've -- if they could 've shored up the borders , right after going in there , that would 've been a -- that would 've been a - a big plus , you know . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know if that could , uh , if that 's a -- plausible goal or not because , uh , it 's just that - that -- a lot of that 's , you know , uh , weapons and terrorists have been , you know , getting through the borders , probably from syria . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
first relief convoy arrives in iraq as allies struggle to clear the way |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the first sizable relief convoy arrived in iraq during a sandstorm wednesday as allied forces struggled to clear the way for more aid shipments , using dolphins to remove mines from waterways and hunting iraqi fighters around the port of umm qasr . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
three days after u.s. president george w. bush promised `` massive amounts '' of humanitarian aid , seven large , battered tractor-trailers arrived in umm qasr carrying food and water donated by kuwaitis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
the convoy was escorted by u.s. soldiers . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O 
`` we planned for 30 trucks but we only got seven loaded because of the severe sandstorm , '' said e.j. russell of the humanitarian operations center , a joint u.s. - kuwaiti agency . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the storm cut visibility to about 100 yards ( 91 meters ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hundreds of cases of water were stacked on three of the trucks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the rest carried boxes of tuna , crackers , sweets and other food . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as the trucks lumbered past blasted buildings on the iraq - kuwait border , an iraqi boy of about 10 pointed to his mouth and shouted `` eat , eat ! '' |||O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
people lined up along the streets , giving thumbs - up signs to the aid convoy as it rolled by and begging for food and cigarettes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
after days of fierce fighting that shut down the city of umm qasr , iraqi youths cheered and swarmed british troops as they handed out yellow meal packets and bottles of water wednesday . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the world food program , a u.n. agency , said it would make its biggest single request for cash in its history _ more than us $ 1 billion to help feed the war - stricken nation for about six months . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
`` this could well turn into the largest humanitarian operation in history , '' said agency spokesman trevor rowe . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
before the war , iraqis depended on government rations distributed under the u.n. 's oil - for - food program . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the 7 - year - old program allows iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil to buy food , medicine and other humanitarian goods . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the proceeds from oil sales are deposited in a u.n. - controlled escrow account . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the war has thrown the future of that program in doubt . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
because the united states and britain failed to get u.n. |||O O O O O O O O O O

kurdish militiamen and u.s. special operations troops linked up with more than 1,000 u.s. army paratroopers thursday to secure the area around a strategic air strip , as the first large coalition ground force in northern iraq began opening another front against saddam hussein 's regime . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the army 's 173rd airborne brigade , including elite army rangers , jumped out of low - flying c - 17 transport planes under cover of darkness wednesday and secured a snow - dusted airfield , which will be used to bring in supplies and support personnel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the airdrop _ one of the biggest paratroop drops in decades _ was a dramatic entry for ground troops into a region where only small groups of u.s. special forces have been operating . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

around dawn thursday , strikes resumed , with a massive explosion just outside the kurdish zone close to the village of kalak . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
warplanes pounded forward iraqi positions in the hills overlooking chamchamal , 35 kilometers ( 22 miles ) east of the key oil city of kirkuk . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
later thursday , kurdish troops in chamchamal advanced their positions between government - controlled and rebel - controlled areas , taking over a iraqi check point on their front with no fighting at this point , witnesses said . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
early thursday , kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads near the airstrip where troops were said to be arriving , outside the town of bashur , about 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) northeast of the kurd - controlled city of irbil and 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) south of the turkish border . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

future airlifts into the area will include supplies and support personnel for the 173rd 's fighters , defense officials said . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the airfield 's 6,700 - foot ( 2,042 - meter ) runway is long enough to land c - 17s and other u.s. military cargo planes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lt . col . thomas collins , a spokesman for the u.s. army 's southern european task force , refused to say whether the paratroopers deployed directly from italy into iraq or had taken a different route . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the matter immediately sparked controversy in italy , where there is a strong anti-war movement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the country 's parliament voted this month to allow u.s. - led coalition forces to use italian air space and military bases _ but not for directs attacks on iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
pentagon officials have said for weeks they would have u.s. forces in northern iraq to open another front against saddam 's forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
the vast majority of the coalition ground troops in iraq are moving toward baghdad from the south after entering from kuwait . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
pentagon officials had hoped to have the army 's 4th infantry division invade iraq from the north , but turkey balked at allowing up to 62,000 u.s. troops on its soil to prepare for that option . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the use of the 173rd shows the military has shifted to a smaller , lighter force . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
military officials say they would have liked to have secured key oil fields around the northern cities of mosul and kirkuk _ and perhaps the cities themselves _ by now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
though no hostilities were expected during the deployment , the 173rd decided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so that a significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protect itself , officers said , according to a u.s. reporter traveling with the 173rd . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the iraqi 's want it , the kurds want it , the turks want it and various other ethnic groups also want it , '' maj . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` what this drop means is that we can secure it until we are relieved by other forces . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
besides mosul and kirkuk , another key target in northern iraq is tikrit , saddam 's hometown and the tribal center for most of his inner circle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most of the adnan division of the republican guard relocated from the mosul area to the tikrit area shortly before the war began . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
another key mission for the 173rd could be to keep order in northern iraq , which is controlled by two semi-autonomous kurdish factions but also includes several splinter groups and a base for the al - qaida - linked ansar al - islam . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
turkey has said it may send more troops into northern iraq to prevent refugees from moving north , while u.s. officials have said they advised turkey against sending large additional forces into northern iraq . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O

at one stage , it appeared that u.s. forces had taken control of the airport , `` and then it got more confusing with continued fighting , myers said thursday night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
capture of the airport would give american and british troops a facility for airlifting equipment and troops to baghdad . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
along the city 's southern edge , u.s. tanks and bradley vehicles destroyed at least seven iraqi armored personnel carriers and more than 15 iraqi tanks in fighting that went on for more than four hours . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O

the security council is scheduled to discuss north korea 's nuclear program on wednesday , and pyongyang has said that any sanctions imposed on it will be tantamount to war . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the u.n. discussions are `` a grave provocation act intended to scuttle all ( the north 's ) effort for dialogue and aggravate the situation on the korean peninsula , '' a north korean foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by state - run news agency kcna . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the security council 's `` handling of the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war , '' the spokesman said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
for months , north korea has insisted on direct talks with the united states to negotiate a nonaggression treaty . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
washington has refused , saying a multilateral solution to the crisis was needed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
administration has been pressing the security council to adopt a statement condemning pyongyang for failing to meet its obligations to prevent the spread of nuclear arms . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but kcna quoted the spokesman as saying that the u.s. invasion of iraq showed that washington was not bound by international agreements . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a nonaggression treaty with pyongyang would not necessarily avert war because it may not be honored , he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was not immediately clear if pyongyang would drop its demand for a nonaggression pact . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
north korea also said washington is `` seriously mistaken '' if it thinks that the communist country will accept the u.s. demand to disarm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it said it will ignore any u.n. resolution on the nuclear issue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the u.n. security council cooperates with u.s. |||O O O O O O O O 
efforts to `` stifle '' north korea , it would leave the north with `` no other option but to beef up the deterrent force for war by mobilizing all the potentials , '' kcna quoted the foreign ministry spokesman as saying . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for weeks , north korea has claimed that the united states plans to attack it after iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
washington says it seeks a diplomatic end , but has not ruled out a military solution . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
last year , u.s. president george w. bush said north korea was part of an `` axis of evil '' along with iraq and iran , and that it was developing weapons of mass destruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
south korea has tried to keep a lid on rising tensions between washington and pyongyang . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but officials in seoul said sunday that north korea had yet to confirm that cabinet - level meetings scheduled to begin monday in pyongyang would go ahead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
seoul had hoped to use the three - day talks to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its suspected nuclear program in return for aid and better relations with the outside world . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
north korea called off two working - level talks with south korea last month . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
also on sunday , south korean lawmakers said they would work to quickly set up a special parliamentary committee to deal with the north 's nuclear issue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the nuclear standoff began in october , when u.s. officials said north korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

since coalition troops seized baghdad 's international airport , they have encircled the heavily - bombed city of 5 million people , blocking off entry and exits and monitored all movement from the air . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in a move weighted with symbolism and tactical importance , a hulking u.s. c - 130 transport plane flew into baghdad 's airport . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
the arrival presaged a major resupply effort by air for u.s. troops , dependent until now on a tenuous line stretching 550 kilometers ( 350 miles ) to kuwait . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

british desert rats went into the city of 1.3 million with more than three dozen tanks and armored cars , a column similar in size to the american unit that probed suburban baghdad . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O

separately , lawyers who claim that iraq helped plan the 1995 oklahoma city bombing that killed 168 people asked a judge at a federal court in new york to force al - douri to testify in the case and hold the envoy in contempt , saying they worry that he would flee the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O

lawyer reprimanded for chiluba 's failure to appear in court |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the lawyer of former zambian president frederick chiluba was reprimanded by a lusaka magistrate when his client failed to appear in court on theft charges friday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
chiluba , who is accused of stealing millions of dollars while in office , did not appear at the lusaka magistrates court as scheduled because he has filed an appeal to have case heard at a higher court . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
chiluba 's lawyer , chifumu banda , told the court he had advised chiluba not to appear in court friday , following an agreement with the prosecution that the case be postponed for a month while the appeal is considered . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
`` the matter is before this court and whether an accused person wishes to request for an adjournment or they wish to be absent for any other reason , such a request must be done here , '' said magistrate christopher shacifwa . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said lawyers could not decide on postponements between themselves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
shacifwa ordered chiluba to appear in court on may 16 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O

she is also likely to open the way for russian companies to vie for lucrative deals in the oil and gas sector , long dominated by american and british resource giants . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although opposite ends of the earth , indonesia and russia have some basic things in common . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
both are geographically sprawling with massive multiethnic populations . |||O O O O O O O O O 
both are struggling to preserve national unity as they fight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decades of authoritarian rule . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
both are resource -rich , but face huge economic problems made worse by endemic corruption . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , currently , both have opposed the u.s. - led war on iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
indonesia 's foreign ministry spokesman marty natalegawa says megawati 's meeting with russian president putin slated for april 21 will touch on the iraq crisis . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom - line issues such as trade and arms sales . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
analysts worry that indonesia 's military is now so degraded it can no longer control the borders of the far - flung archipelago , allowing for easy infiltration by extremists . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
last year 's bali bombings , which killed 202 people , illustrated the threat of terrorism in indonesia . |||O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , broad opposition to the u.s. - led attack on iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant islamists . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` nearly everybody in indonesia sees this iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to u.s. policies , '' said jusuf wanadi of the center for strategic and international studies in jakarta . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
close ties between moscow and jakarta are not unprecedented . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
indonesia relied on soviet military assistance in the 1950s under megawati 's father and founding president sukarno , but these were severed after the anti-communist gen. suharto seized power in 1965 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the united states quickly became the southeast asian country 's main weapons supplier , and annual arms sales peaked at us $ 400 million in the 1980s . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
in 1991 , however , the u.s. congress banned this after indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in east timor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
in 1999 , east timor became free , but only after indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
the shocking level of destruction prompted u.s. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with indonesia . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
since then some in the bush administration _ particularly deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , a former ambassador to jakarta and a prime architect of the iraq war _ have pushed for the ban to be repealed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
so far , u.s. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer training program . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but that 's far from enough for indonesia 's generals . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
``i think the indonesian military has finally decided that restrictions and conditionalities from washington are just not worth it , '' said juwono sudarsono , a former defense minister . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` so they want to look for alternative sources for planes , helicopters and other hardware . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
moscow has already had some success in wooing indonesia as a customer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jakarta has recently purchased some russian weapons , including 10,000 kalashnikov assault rifles , a squadron of naval mil - 2 helicopters and a dozen btr - 80 a amphibious carriers for its marines . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
currently , indonesia uses short - range rapier missiles purchased 30 years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in sumatra , borneo and papua from air attack . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
`` replenishing them has been a big problem , '' sudarsono said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
air defense commanders want to augment the rapiers with russia 's impressive long - range s- 300 missiles , or shorter - range systems such as the sa - 15 gauntlet or shoulder - fired igla . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the air force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons of sukhoi su - 27 interceptors , considered the world 's premier dogfighters . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
previously , indonesian air force commanders preferred western jets that were compatible with the u.s. - made f - 16 fighter - bombers already in the indonesian inventory . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but neighboring malaysia 's success in integrating russian mig - 29s and american f/ a - 18 hornets persuaded them otherwise , sudarsono said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if megawati does stiff - arm the united states on the weapons issue , it is unlikely relations with washington will be permanently damaged . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
whatever happens , indonesia , a mainly muslim but politically secular state , is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious militancy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what could be more worrying for washington is russia 's economic ambitions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
trade between indonesia and russia increased by dlrs 36.2 million to dlrs 203.5 million in 2001 _ the last year for which statistics are available . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
analysts say this can only grow . |||O O O O O O O 
the real concerns , though , are in the petroleum sector . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
megawati and putin are expected to sign agreements to give russian companies a toehold in indonesia 's oil and gas industry , long dominated by american and british giants such as exxon mobil and bp . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
czech nuclear plant gets permission to produce at full capacity |||O O O O O O O O O O

pavel pitterman , the spokesman for the state office for nuclear safety , said his office gave the plant permission to run its second , newer 1,000 - megawatt unit at full capacity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the plant 's first 1,000 - megawatt unit has already operated at full capacity during past tests . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the spokesman for the temelin plant , milan nebesar , said that an 18 - month trial production at full capacity at the second unit , needed to declare the unit ready for commercial production , would start friday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the plant , based on russian design and upgraded with u.s. technology , has been plagued by frequent , non-nuclear malfunctions since testing began in november 2000 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
located just 60 kilometers ( 35 miles ) north of the austrian border , it has been a source of friction between the two countries . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
critics in non-nuclear austria argue the plant is unsafe and demand that it be shut down , but czech authorities insist the plant is safe . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the plant 's first unit , currently shut down for planned maintenance scheduled to take two months , has already entered the last stage of tests and should be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

u.s. officials invited the groups , which picked their own representatives . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
many iraqis boycotted the meeting in opposition to u.s. plans to install garner atop an interim administration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
thousands of shiites _ who constitute iraq 's most populous religious group but were repressed under saddam hussein _ demonstrated in nearby nasiriyah , chanting `` no to america and no to saddam ! '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` iraq needs an iraqi interim government . |||O O O O O O O O 
anything other than this tramples the rights of the iraqi people and will be a return to the era of colonization , '' said abdul aziz hakim , a leader of the largest iraqi shiite group , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. officials hope more iraqis join the process and stressed that this was just the first of many such meetings in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
the meeting concluded with the delegates voting by show of hands to meet again in 10 days . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
a national conference is planned to select the interim administration , perhaps within weeks , a senior u.s. official said on condition of anonymity . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

gen . tim cross , the top british member of garner 's team . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` one has to go through the process of building from the bottom up , allowing the leadership to establish itself , and then the election process to go through and so forth , '' cross said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O

tuesday 's meeting was the first step toward that goal after the ouster of saddam . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
sheik ayad jamal al din , a shiite religious leader from nasiriyah , urged the delegates to craft a secular government , according to a pool report . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
but nassar hussein musawi , a schoolteacher , disagreed : `` those who would like to separate religion from the state are simply dreaming , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iraqi exile hatem mukhliss quoted president john f. kennedy 's exhortation , `` ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country , '' and called on iraqis to write a constitution , establish a legal system and consider what role the army should play . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he asked coalition representatives to address problems of security , electricity and water in iraq and help rebuild destroyed and looted hospitals . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
`` saddam reduced the country to such a state that it was necessary for people to sell off personal possessions , '' mukhliss said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` now it 's time to take our country back . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are already tensions between the united states and some iraqi factions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kurdish groups appear unwilling to compromise on their demand to expand the border of their autonomous area to include the oil - rich city of kirkuk and kurdish parts of the city of mosul . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that could pose a problem for the united states , because turkey worries that kurdish control of kirkuk could lead to aspirations for independence and in turn encourage separatist kurds in turkey . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iraqi opposition leaders fear the united states is trying to force ahmed chalabi , head of the london - based umbrella iraqi national congress , on them as leader of a new iraqi administration . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
chalabi was the first top iraqi opposition leader to be airlifted by the u.s. military into southern iraq as the fighting wound down , and he and other top members of his group plan to meet soon in baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
u.s. officials said chalabi was brought in because he offered forces to the coalition . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
neither chalabi nor many other leaders of anti-saddam groups attended tuesday 's meeting , but they sent delegates . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
iraqis protesting the conference said it did not represent their interests . |||O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
the protesters held banners written in english and arabic saying the `` hawza , '' or the shiite religious seminary in najaf , represents them . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even some of those at the meeting said they did not want garner leading the interim administration . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` we will press for any iraqi civilian administration regardless of what the americans say . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
an administration by garner is not acceptable , '' said mowaffak al - rubaie , an iraqi physician and opposition activist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

grigory pasko 's lawyer genri reznik filed the appeal with russian supreme court , the interfax and itar - tass news agencies reported . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he asked the court to invalidate the verdict and throw out the criminal case against pasko , they said . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
pasko was sentenced to four years in prison in december 2001 for illegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and taking notes there . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
a military court said he intended to pass the notes to japanese media with which he had worked . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
pasko , whose sentence included time served , was released in january for good behavior after serving more than two - thirds of the sentence . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
he has maintained his innocence , saying the military was punishing him for exposing environmental abuses by the russian navy , including the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reznik said an initial appeal he lodged the day pasko was freed never reached the presidium of the supreme court , according to interfax . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the lawyer said the court 's military board had refused to launch proceedings on the appeal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O

as u.s. forces struggled to restore order in iraq , fbi director robert mueller announced that agents had been detailed to help recover antiquities looted from museums in baghdad and elsewhere . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
agents will aid international efforts to recover stolen items `` on both the open and black markets , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with the fighting all but over , the uss constellation steamed from the persian gulf for it s home port , carrying dozens of warplanes no longer needed . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was the second aircraft carrier ordered home in recent days . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the u.s. military 's search for chemical and biological weapons is unlikely to succeed until iraqis lead american forces to them , defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld said thursday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
``i do n't think we 'll discover anything , myself , '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rumsfeld said at a meeting with pentagon employees . |||O O O O O O O O O 
`` i think what will happen is we 'll discover people who will tell us where to go find it . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. troops have found suspicious chemicals and facilities at a number of sites but tests on the materials have proved negative or inconclusive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eliminating such weapons was a chief reason president george w. bush gave for the u.s. - led invasion of iraq that began march 20 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
brooks announced the capture of barzan ibrahim hasan al - tikriti , telling reporters he was an adviser to saddam `` with extensive knowledge of the regime 's inner workings . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a u.s. intelligence official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said barzan ibrahim had been a presidential adviser to saddam 's regime since 1998 , but had a shaky relationship with his half brother and was not part of the regime 's inner circle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was a representative to the united nations in geneva from 1989 to 1998 . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
earlier , from 1979 to 1983 , he headed iraq 's mukhabarat , or intelligence service , a period when the organization arranged executions of regime opponents in iraq and overseas , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
brooks provided scant details of the operation that netted barzan ibrahim , saying he was taken inside baghdad and that u.s. special forces were aided by marines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said there were no casualties . |||O O O O O O O 
another of saddam 's three half brothers , watban ibrahim hasan al - tikriti , was captured earlier by u.s. forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the third has not been found . |||O O O O O O O 
american forces have been criticized for failing to stop looting in several baghdad cities , and there have been complaints , as well , that humanitarian relief has been slow in arriving . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but marines foiled a brazen act of lawlessness during the day when they interrupted a robbery - in - progress at a branch of the al - rashid bank and took away us $ 4 million for safekeeping . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thieves had blown a hole in the vault and dropped children in to bring out fistfuls of cash . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as word spread that the robbery was under way , iraqis gathered , saying they had accounts at the branch , and a riot broke out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
marines broke it up _ over the protests of iraqis not involved in the robbery _ and the thieves were arrested . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
`` these people want the money and they believe it is rightfully their money , but they do n't understand that the proper distribution is not first - come , first - served , '' said col . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
philip decamp , a battalion commander . |||O O O O O O O 
gen . tommy franks , the commander of operation iraqi freedom , told reporters during a visit to kuwait that `` the looting goes down every day and i think you will continue to see it go down because the iraqis are now stepping up and controlling the problems for themselves . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there was evidence of slow progress . |||O O O O O O O 
baghdad residents gathered outside the city 's police academy when word spread that some of the cars looted in recent days had been recovered . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
still , more than a week after the regime collapsed , marine staff sgt . jose guillen said power has been restored _ by use of diesel plants _ to only about 500 homes in baghdad , a city of roughly 5 million . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

unrest continued in other parts of the country . |||O O O O O O O O O 
americans sought to bring calm to mosul , where u.s. troops killed 17 people in clashes earlier in the week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
brooks , briefing reporters at the u.s. central command headquarters , also disclosed that marines had broken up violent clashes on wednesday in tikrit , saddam 's hometown . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
the fighting broke out between club-wielding members of the former ruler 's clan and a rival group , he said . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
clan rivalries aside , there are numerous other resentments shaping events in the post-saddam era . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
majority shiite muslims are eager for power after decades of saddam favoring sunni muslims , for example . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and kurds are eager to claim what they say saddam took from them and gave to arabs in the northern part of the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
international experts , appalled at the looting of iraqi historical artifacts , met in paris under u.n. auspices and called for a temporary embargo on iraqi cultural objects . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some of the participants at the meeting said it appeared the looting was organized , and some of those involved had keys to museum vaults and were able to remove items from safes . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one suggested the effort was organized from outside iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
`` it looks as if part of the looting was a deliberate planned action , '' said mcguire gibson , a university of chicago professor and president of the american association for research in baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` i have a suspicion it was organized outside the country , in fact i 'm pretty sure it was , '' gibson said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he added that if a good police team was put together , `` i think it could be cracked in no time . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the baghdad museum housed irreplaceable babylonian , sumerian and assyrian collections that chronicled ancient life in the cradle of civilization , the area around the tigris and euphrates rivers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
malaysian court rejects anwar 's appeal against sodomy conviction |||O O O O O O O O O 
malaysia 's second highest court on friday rejected an appeal by jailed former deputy prime minister anwar ibrahi m against his conviction and nine - year prison sentence for sodomy . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
a three - judge panel of the court of appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by high court judge arifin jaka nearly three years ago that found anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife 's former driver . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sodomy is a crime in this predominantly muslim southeast asian country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anwar is expected to appeal again with the federal court , malaysia 's highest court . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
speaking to reporters after the verdict , anwar lambasted the judges , saying they had been `` preselected '' by the government to quash his appeal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
`` these are spineless judges , '' anwar said . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
`` this decision is all scripted . '' |||O O O O O O O O 
the judges also rejected an application by anwar to be released on bail . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but anwar 's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
on monday , anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges , after the six - year sentence was reduced by one - third for good behavior . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he then began serving the nine - year prison sentence for sodomy , his lawyers said . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
prime minister mahathir mohamad fired anwar , his former protege , in 1998 following disputes over financial policy . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anwar led large protests against mahathir before he was arrested , charged and convicted on corruption and sodomy charges . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O 
anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging mahathir for power . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
human rights group amnesty international said friday 's verdict `` represents another step in the further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` this decision adds to the already widespread perception that in politically sensitive cases , the independence of the judiciary can no longer be guaranteed , '' the london - based group said in a statement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` today , the situation looks much bleaker . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O 
param cumaraswamy , the u.n. special investigator on the freedom of judges and lawyers , said in a statement : `` so long as there are judges who are prepared to and continue to compromise the value and principles of their high office ... there is no hope for judicial independence and impartiality in the malaysian justice system . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
about 200 demonstrators outside the court shouted anwar 's slogan of `` reformasi ! '' for political change . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
police armed with automatic weapons stood by to prevent rowdiness . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the court also dismissed a joint appeal by anwar 's adopted brother , sukma darmawan , who was convicted together with anwar for sodomy in august 2000 and sentenced to six years in jail and whipping . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O

he did not provide the baby 's name or other details . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

the due date was april 27 , the same day as game 4 of the best - of - seven series between the timberwolves and the lakers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
teammate kobe bryant said he would not be surprised if o'neal had a big game sunday despite his expected late arrival in minneapolis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
`` you just roll off the adrenaline , '' said bryant , who scored 48 points in a 2001 playoff game at sacramento after leaving the team to attend to a personal matter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

france proposes suspending u.n. sanctions against iraq , a step toward u.s. goal |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
france on tuesday proposed immediately suspending u.n. sanctions targeting iraq civilians , an important step toward the u.s. goal of ending trade embargoes that have crippled the country 's economy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the surprise move by france , which led opposition to the u.s. war against iraq , followed last week 's call by u.s. president george w. bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly , so iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
france 's u.n. ambassador , jean - marc de la sabliere , made the proposal at a security council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix and for the first time exchanged views on potentially divisive postwar issues . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
the proposal would end the u.n. ban on trade and investment in iraq while leaving a 12 - year - old arms embargo in place . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the security council imposed sanctions after iraq 's 1990 invasion of kuwait . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
under council resolutions , sanctions can not be lifted until u.n. inspectors certify that iraq 's nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been destroyed along with the long - range missiles to deliver them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
along with france , russia , germany and china also strongly opposed the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
but de la sabliere said before the meeting that security council `` must take into account the new realities on the ground . '' |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
russian ambassador sergey lavrov had said his country is `` not at all opposed to the lifting of sanctions . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but he said russia wants u.n. inspectors to certify that iraq has been disarmed of all weapons of mass destruction , as required under u.n. resolutions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
asked about the french proposal , he said : `` we are ready to discuss it . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at another closed - door council meeting later tuesday , the council was to hear from benon sevan , head of the u.n. oil - for - food program , which had been providing food for 60 percent of iraq 's 24 million people . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
france 's de la sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase out the oil - for - food program , which allowed iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and compensation to victims of the first gulf war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` there should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out of this program , '' de la sabliere said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
these include not only iraq 's disarmament and the future of sanctions but the u.n. role in iraq now that the fighting is over , control of iraq 's oil revenue , and lucrative reconstruction contracts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blix stressed that council resolutions call for u.n. inspectors to have access to all sites and people in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said he told the council that he believes the world would like iraq 's disarmament confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the country for over 10 years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the bush administration , which accused blix of hindering its drive for international support for the war , has already sent its own teams to iraq to search for illegal weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` at the moment , the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for disarming iraq , '' u.s. ambassador john negroponte , said tuesday when asked whether u.s. teams would work with u.n. inspectors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said important scientists had turned themselves in , and the atmosphere had changed which should enable any iraqi ``to speak more freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking them the questions . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
france 's de la sabliere said he also proposed that the council `` find practical and pragmatic arrangements '' to coordinate and combine the work of the american teams and the work of u.n. inspectors `` so that the iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he told the associated press he envisioned sanctions being suspended `` for a couple of months , '' and possibly renewed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he also envisioned u.s. and u.n. inspectors working together . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
`` and then sanctions could be lifted when a legitimate iraqi government is in place , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in an interview with bbc radio aired tuesday , blix said that before the war , the u.s. and britain appeared to have used `` shaky '' intelligence , including forged documents , in an effort to prove iraq had banned weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blix said it was `` very , very disturbing '' that u.s. intelligence failed to identify as fakes documents suggesting iraq tried to buy uranium from the west african nation of niger . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he told reporters at the united nations on tuesday that the contract about `` yellow cake '' uranium `` was more than shaky , it was a fake . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.n. inspectors went back to iraq for the first time in four years in late november and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3 { months of searching . |||O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
secretary -general kofi annan ordered all u.n. international staff , including the inspectors , to leave iraq just before the war began on march 20 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
he has said he expects them to return . |||O O O O O O O O O 
annan also said tuesday in austria that iraqis should be in charge of their own future and natural resources . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he acknowledged that ` ` the u.n. is being challenged '' but said he expected an agreement on the u.n. role in iraq in the `` not too distant future . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. wo n't choose subcontractors for rebuilding iraq , u.s. official says |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the u.s. assistant secretary of state for europe and eurasia said tuesday that the u.s. government wo n't be involved in choosing subcontractors for american companies named to help rebuild iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` the way it works is that there have been an initial set of contracts let to us companies , since it 's u.s. money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those companies can subcontract to any company they want , '' elizabeth jones said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we ca n't direct commerce , '' jones said . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
`` once it 's a commercial proposition , then international bidding processes come into effect . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

north korea tough talk provides backdrop for second day of nuclear talks with united states , china |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
talks between north korea , the united states and china ended thursday with u.s. state department officials saying it was uncertain whether discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear program would continue . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although north korea accused the united states of leading the region toward war in its state media , u.s. officials denied reports the talks had broken down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
north korea also hinted during the meetings that they have nuclear weapons and may conduct a test , a u.s. official said . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
earlier , secretary of state colin powell had told a gathering of experts from the asia - pacific region that the talks had concluded , leaving the impression there would not be a third day of discussions on friday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
powell also expressed hope that south korea and japan will be able to participate `` when and if '' there is another round of talks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
`` north korea should not leave the meetings having the slightest impression that they might force us to make a concession we would not otherwise make , '' he added . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but u.s. state department officials , asking not to be identified , said there may be more meetings on friday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they said reports of a breakdown in the talks were a `` misrepresentation . '' |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
one official said : `` we had the opportunity to say what we needed to say and to hear what the north koreans wanted to tell us . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a u.s. official said the north koreans implied during the talks that they have nuclear weapons and that they may conduct a test . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the official said there are no indications a test is imminent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he acknowledged that preparations for an underground test could be concealed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
according to the official , a north korean nuclear detonation would deplete by half their estimated stockpile of two weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in beijing , chief u.s. negotiator , assistant secretary of state james kelly , declined to answer questions , saying only the sides `` had talks . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao refused to provide details , but said the talks were `` conducive to mutual understanding and finding ways to resolve the north korean nuclear question peacefully . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
discussions were scheduled to end friday , when kelly was to fly to seoul the same day to meet with south korean officials . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
the talks are the first high - level u.s. - north korean contact since tensions over the north 's nuclear program spiked six months ago over washington 's claim that the north said in october it was trying to develop nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 pledge . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the north has disputed the u.s. claim . |||O O O O O O O O 
washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments to north korea as punishment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the north retaliated by withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , expelling u.n. inspectors and restarting a plutonium -producing reactor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
north korea , which is seeking a guarantee from the united states that it wo n't be attacked , ratcheted up the threat of conflict in a statement issued by its official korean central news agency accusing washington of escalating tensions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the north 's leaders fear they could be the next target for u.s. military action . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` the situation on the korean peninsula is so tense that a war may break out any moment due to the u.s. moves , '' the kcna statement said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it said relations with the united states had hit ` ` rock bottom '' because u.s. president george w. bush named north korea as part of an `` axis of evil , '' along with iran and iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kcna said the war in iraq had shown the only way for a country to protect itself was to have a strong military deterrent . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
officials from seoul and washington say the swift u.s. - led victory in iraq prompted north korea to agree to the nuclear talks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
north korea said the `` master key '' for successful talks was for the united states to drop it s hostile policy toward pyongyang . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in a likely reference to north korea 's demand for a nonaggression treaty with washington , kcna said : `` the u.s. should settle the talks from a sincere stand and strive to settle the essential issue . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
washington has refused to offer a formal treaty but says it would consider some sort of written assurance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the north also likely wants aid for its economy , which has been crippled by the loss of soviet subsidies and years of drought and mismanagement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
north korea and china fought against the united states in the 1950 - 53 korean war , which ended without a peace treaty . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
north korea and washington have no formal relations and are still technically at war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
china , the north 's ally and major aid donor , says it does n't want pyongyang to acquire nuclear weapons and has appealed for a negotiated settlement to the crisis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a u.s. official praised the chinese contribution to the discussions . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
he said china 's delegate specifically called for a denuclearized korean peninsula and made specific reference to a 1992 promise pyongyang made to south korea not to develop nuclear weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

rudolph giuliani will wed his companion , judith nathan , on may 24 in the ex-mayor 's old home , gracie mansion . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the news was announced thursday by giuliani spokeswoman sunny mindel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
his successor , mayor michael bloomberg , will perform the ceremony . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
giuliani , 58 , proposed to nathan , a former nurse , during a november business trip to paris _ five months after he finalized his divorce from donna hanover after 20 years of marriage . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
in interviews last year , giuliani said nathan gave him `` tremendous emotional support '' through his treatment for prostate cancer and as he led the city during the aftermath of the sept. 11 terrorist attack on the world trade center . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
`` we were close already , '' giuliani said . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
`` and then we went through hell together . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O 
giuliani and nathan began appearing in public together in may 2000 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
soon after , he announced that he and hanover were moving toward legal separation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
during the legal proceedings leading up to the divorce , a judge ruled that nathan could not visit gracie mansion , the official mayoral residence , as long as giuliani 's children lived there . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
giuliani and hanover have two teenage children , andrew and caroline . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the divorce settlement called for giuliani to pay hanover more than $ 6.8 million . |||O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
hanover , 53 , is host of a syndicated television show , `` famous homes and hideaways . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
last month , she and her fiance _ an old high school sweetheart _ invited the press along as they went shopping for wedding bands , saying they are planning a wedding in the new york city area this summer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
giuliani 's first marriage to his second cousin , regina peruggi , lasted about 14 years . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was annulled by the catholic church because the couple had not obtained a church dispensation required when second cousins marry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
nathan divorced wallpaper salesman bruce nathan in 1992 . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
they have a teenage daughter . |||O O O O O O 
the giuliani - nathan nuptials will be a first for bloomberg , who is making an exception from his policy of not performing weddings , said bloomberg spokesman ed skyler . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
giuliani regularly officiated at weddings while in office . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O

report : accident on chinese submarine kills all 70 aboard |||O O O O O O O O O O 
an accident on a diesel - powered chinese submarine has killed all 70 officers and sailors aboard , the official xinhua news agency reported friday . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the accident occurred `` recently '' in chinese waters east of the neichangshan islands , the brief chinese - language report said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the islands are in the yellow sea , between the northeastern province of liaoning and north korea . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred , and `` because of a mechanical malfunction , the 70 crew members on board died , '' the xinhua report said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
it did not give further details or say how the crew died . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port , xinhua said . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
it said the hull number was 361 , which military analysts said appeared to make it a ming - class submarine , a vessel used for patrols and coastal defense . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the announcement was unusual for a communist government that rarely acknowledges military accidents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was the first time china has announced a fatal submarine mishap , said bernard cole , a professor at the u.n. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
national war college in washington and a specialist on the chinese navy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` there have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines , but this is the first fatal accident that i know of , '' said cole . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
china 's military , which has a tradition of secrecy , did not comment about the accident friday night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for an accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing the vessel to be recovered . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they suggested possible causes ranging from a sinking in shallow water to a disaster that flooded the vessel with toxic chemical fumes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
michael mcginty , an expert on the chinese navy from the royal united services institute for defense studies in london , said that the mishap likely happened while the submarine was on the surface . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the accident happened when the vessel was underwater , it was less likely that china could have recovered it , said mcginty , a former british submariner . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` for an accident to have been so catastrophic when the submarine was on the surface , i find it a very mysterious thing , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mcginty said that the submarine 's batteries might have leaked acid that mixed with seawater , creating toxic chlorine gas that killed the crew . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
the torpedoes might have leaked propellant that poisoned the crew , he said . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the accident could have occurred as long ago as march , said cole , a former u.s. navy antisubmarine warfare officer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` there have been exercises going on in the yellow sea over the past two months , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` this boat could have been involved in those exercises and gone down over a month ago . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
cole said the loss of all hands suggested the vessel was flooded or sank because of a collision or engineering problem . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said ming - class subs usually carry a crew of 50 , suggesting that the others aboard might have been technicians or staff officers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
china began building the ming - class subs in the 1970s , and they are obsolete by modern standards , according to the federation of american scientists . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the first three ming - class subs were completed between 1971 and 1979 , and one of them was scrapped after a fire , according to the web site of jane 's information group , a leading of source defense information . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
china is believed to have as many as 19 ming - class submarines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
china 's submarine fleet includes 66 boats , most of them aging diesel - electric vessels , mcginty said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said the fleet suffers from a chronic lack of money , training and maintenance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the chinese are aggressively updating their fleet with russian - made kilo - class diesel - electric subs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` the submarine force is the most potent part of the chinese navy , '' said cole . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
despite the difficulty of maintaining a fleet , subs are valuable because they are hard to detect , cole said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in a conflict over taiwan or some other confrontation , he said , `` china 's ability to field a force of even a dozen submarines could pose a big problem for any other naval force . '' |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
xinhua said former president jiang zemin , who is chairman of the commission that runs china 's military , on friday sent condolences to family members of the crew . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. , britain drafting resolution limiting u.n. role in iraq to humanitarian relief |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the united states and britain are preparing a resolution that would give the united nations a role in humanitarian relief but not peacekeeping in iraq , a senior official in u.s. president george w. bush 's administration said friday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
separately , the united states has decided to divide the military and humanitarian relief mission in iraq into three parts under american , british and polish command , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
six european countries have agreed to contribute troops to the british and polish sectors to create an international stability force , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
the draft resolution would limit the u.n. role to helping with refugees and displaced people , reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
the united states and britain agree on all but a few of the fine details of the resolution , the official said , though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.n. officials are already in iraq providing humanitarian relief . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
u.n. secretary general kofi annan said this week that the body has no interest in policing a postwar iraq , although it could contribute to the political resuscitation of the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` take the question of security . |||O O O O O O O 
i do n't think the u.n. would want to take on that , '' annan said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` there has been a suggestion that the u.n. wanted to take over the whole iraq and run it , which was also not the case . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what the united nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance was `` political facilitation , '' annan said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance from other u.n. security council members who have favored a u.n. - convened conference of the kind that helped establish afghanistan 's post-taliban government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld discussed the resolution with prime minister tony blair and defense secretary geoff hoon on friday as rumsfeld returned from a tour of iraq , afghanistan and the persian gulf region . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rumsfeld said afterward he hoped the u.n. would play a role but did not publicly discuss the draft resolution outlining that role . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hoon , who joined rumsfeld in a news conference at heathrow airport , also did not mention the draft resolution . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` we are right to be optimistic about the way forward '' in iraq , hoon said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
international stability forces will be sent to iraq as soon as possible , the u.s. official said , though it was unclear when that would be . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those troops will work to restore and maintain order and supervise humanitarian projects such as the restoration of water and electricity and delivery of food and medical aid . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the six nations contributing troops are italy , spain , ukraine , denmark , the netherlands and bulgaria , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
representatives of those countries will meet with british officials may 7 and polish officials may 22 to determine what forces each country will contribute and whether they will be put under british or polish command . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the u.s. part of the stability force will be comprised of american troops . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while that portion is likely to consist of a military division _ about 20,000 _ the troop strength of the other two sectors has yet to be determined , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the international stabilization force would be under the u.s. war commander , gen. tommy franks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at least initially , the coalition stability forces will augment rather than replace the 135,000 american troops inside iraq , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the stability forces will focus on providing security and humanitarian relief while other u.s. troops focus on rooting out leftover members of saddam hussein 's government and other armed elements in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rumsfeld said , however , that the more troops other countries contribute to the stability effort , the fewer u.s. troops will be needed inside iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
planning for both the u.n. resolution and the international security force left out france , germany and russia , three u.s. allies that vehemently opposed the war in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
some of the nato members who agreed to send troops may want nato authorization for that action , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
requests for such authorization will be routed through the alliance 's defense planning committee , which does not include france , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the outlines for the international stability force were decided at a conference hoon hosted wednesday with representatives from 16 countries , mostly nato members . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
other countries including the philippines , south korea , qatar and australia agreed to send other help such as field hospitals , engineers , explosive ordnance disposal teams or nuclear , biological and chemical weapons experts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the u.s. , british and polish sectors will be drawn to take into account ethnic , religious , tribal and political factions within iraq , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for example , although ethnic kurds are the majority in large parts of northern iraq , there are also large numbers of kurds within baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some arab countries also want to play a role in the stability operation in iraq but are reluctant to send troops because of political , religious and ethnic considerations , the official said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
countries in the gulf cooperation council have offered to donate money for the effort . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
rumsfeld also met friday with king abdullah of jordan , an american ally in the middle east . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
defense officials say jordan provided key help in the iraq war , acting as a staging area for u.s. special operations raids into western iraq to prevent missiles from being fired at jordan or israel . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
rumsfeld did not say what the two discussed . |||O O O O O O O O O

washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis , although u.s. officials have not ruled out a military option . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
north korea `` keenly felt that the denuclearization of the korean peninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the u.s. drops it s hostile policy toward the dprk , '' kcna said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it said the u.s. invasion of iraq taught it that `` a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons .

during the talks in beijing , u.s. officials said north korea claimed it already possesses nuclear weapons , and that it had reprocessed 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods _ a move that could yield several atomic bombs within months . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

there was no immediate claim of responsibility for monday 's attack at the shaarei amaki m mall in the working class town of afula , which has been targeted repeatedly by palestinian militants because of its proximity to the west bank . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the islamic militant group hamas carried out four bombings over the weekend . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the afula explosion _ the 95th in 32 months of fighting _ went off at 5:14 p.m. ( 1414 gmt ) at the entrance to the mall , reportedly as shoppers were waiting in line for a security check . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
malls and other public places have significantly stepped up security since the outbreak of israeli- palestinian fighting in september 2000 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O

israel holds the palestinian leader responsible for the latest violence , even though the recent attacks were carried out by islamic militants . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
hamas said monday it has no intention of halting attacks , despite egypt 's efforts to have palestinian militant groups agree to a one - year suspension of shootings and bombings . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O

israel said there will be no letup in its campaign against those involved in violence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
israel `` will continue to fight terror everywhere , at any time and in any way possible , '' a cabinet statement said sunday , after a hamas suicide bomber killed seven israelis on a jerusalem bus earlier in the day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O

israel first threatened such a boycott several weeks ago , but enforced it only selectively . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the european union on monday dismissed the decision and a spokeswoman said eu leaders will continue to involve arafat in the search for peace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
arafat , who has been confined by israel to the west bank town of ramallah for more than a year , accused israel of inciting against him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` not to forget i condemned it completely , these terrorist activities , '' arafat said monday in halting english , speaking before the afula bombing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
`` at the same time , you should remember ( israel 's ) incitement policy against me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

where did it happen that a president was forbidden from moving out of his office ? '' |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the new palestinian prime minister , mahmoud abbas , has denounced violence against israelis , but also told sharon in a weekend meeting _ the first israeli- palestinian summit in three years _ that he wants to persuade the militants to stop attacks , rather than disarm them by force . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
the argument over how rein in the militants and halt violence has been holding up implementation of the road map . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the plan calls for parallel steps in the first stage , including a palestinian crackdown on militants , an israeli troop pullback from palestinian towns and a construction freeze in jewish settlements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
sharon insists the palestinians make the first move . |||O O O O O O O O O

israeli analyst mark heller said that `` hamas is trying to ensure that the road map does n't go anywhere and that abu mazen ( abbas ) does n't go anywhere either . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the three bombers came from hebron and at one point studied at the polytechnic institute in the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
two bombers , fuad qawasmeh , 18 , and bassem takrouri , 19 , lived in the same hebron neighborhood and were friends . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a summit between sharon and his palestinian counterpart , mahmoud abbas , had been planned for wednesday but was postponed , according to israeli and palestinian officials , who blamed each other for the delay . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the officials said no new date had been set ; israel radio said the meeting would take place thursday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
a three - way summit with u.s. president george w. bush could take place as early as next week , possibly in jordan . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16 - year - old palestinian boy and wounded a 7 - year - old boy after opening fire at stone throwers in the tulkarem refugee camp in the west bank on tuesday , palestinian hospital officials said . |||O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the army said troops fired , and hit a boy , after a palestinian youth threw a molotov cocktail . |||O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
in a village near the west bank city of nablus on tuesday , israeli troops opened fire on youths throwing stones , hitting a 9 - year - old palestinian boy in the head and critically wounding him , and hitting two 12 - year - old boys in the legs , lightly wounding them , palestinian hospital officials said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
a 10 - year - old boy was struck in the leg by a rubber bullet , but was not seriously hurt , the officials said . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
military sources said troops were trying to break up stone - throwing protests , but did not use live fire . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the army was not aware of any injuries . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
five palestinian children , a palestinian woman and a police officer , were injured tuesday after accidentally detonating explosives in the west bank city of hebron , palestinian security officials said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the children found the explosives in two plastic bags under a tree and accidentally detonated the first bag . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after a police officer arrived , the second bag exploded , seriously injuring him , the officials said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
israeli troops killed a palestinian teenager monday and another surrendered after infiltrating from gaza , the military said . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
they were unarmed and apparently looking for work . |||O O O O O O O O O 
in a village near the west bank town of qalqiliya , an 11 - year - old palestinian boy was killed during an exchange of gunfire . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O 
also monday , israeli soldiers fired on four diplomatic vehicles in the northern gaza town of beit hanoun , diplomats said . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there were no injuries from the incident . |||O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O 
peter lundberg , an official from the swedish consulate in jerusalem , said that two bullets hit the windshield of the swiss consulate 's armored car , and that small - arms fire also was directed at other cars from sweden , denmark and the european union . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
military sources said the israeli army had established roadblocks at the entrance to beit hanoun to prevent palestinians militants from leaving the area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
the sources said shots had been fired in the air when vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the violence erupted after sharon endured withering criticism monday from members of his own likud party over his cabinet 's acceptance of the u.s. - backed ` ` road map '' peace plan . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sharon indicated a 180 - degree turnaround after decades of warning that an israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the west bank could endanger israel 's existence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
skeptics , however , wondered whether sharon 's conversion was a shrewd effort to deflect u.s. pressure in the hopes the road map would fail before israel had to make tough concessions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` to keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and them , '' sharon said in remarks broadcast on israel radio . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the term `` occupation '' is anathema to the israeli right , which believes israel has a legitimate claim to the west bank and gaza strip for religious and security reasons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
palestinians and their dovish israeli allies routinely use the word `` occupation '' when demanding that israel leave the west bank and gaza and dismantle jewish settlements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
palestinians claim all of the west bank and gaza for a state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on sunday , sharon 's cabinet conditionally approved the ` ` road map , '' a three - phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisages a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip in 2005 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political solution to the conflict , including an israeli withdrawal from west bank population centers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
do you want to remain forever in ramallah , jenin , nablus ? '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of the palestinians and endangers israel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in his remarks monday , sharon left himself an out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` what will happen if palestinian terror continues ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
the palestinians will get nothing , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
critics have said sharon 's long - held condition that all violence must stop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of any peace initiative , including the road map , thus releasing him from the necessity of following through on his remarks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
liberal lawmaker yossi sarid argued sharon was trying to keep his intentions murky to persuade the u.s. government that he was committed to the plan , while his hawkish allies could assume he was just making a tactical move to end u.s. pressure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` ariel sharon likes to walk in the fog , because then no one knows where he is headed , '' sarid wrote in the yediot |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. lawmaker : north korea says it will produce more nukes |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
north korea has told american lawmakers it already has nuclear weapons and intends to build more , a senior u.s. congressman said monday after returning from a trip to the communist state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O 
`` they admitted to having nuclear capability and weapons at this moment , '' said rep . curt weldon , who headed a delegation of u.s. lawmakers that visited pyongyang for three days ending sunday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
`` they admitted to an effort to expand their nuclear production program . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
weldon 's comments echoed those of u.s. officials following talks in beijing in april . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
they said that north korea claimed during a pause in the formal talks that it already had nuclear weapons , but would give up the program in return for economic aid and security guarantees . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
weldon said at a news conference in seoul that north korean vice foreign minister kim kye gwan repeated that claim during a dinner meeting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
both kim and foreign minister paek nam sun told weldon that pyongyang planned to produce more nuclear weapons and had nearly finished reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel rods needed to do so , despite pressure from the united states and its allies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` they admitted to having just about completed the reprocessing of 8,000 rods , '' said weldon , a republican who is the no. 2 member of a u.s. house panel that oversees the armed forces . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. experts say that reprocessing the rods could give north korea several more nuclear bombs within months . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
during their visit to pyongyang , weldon 's delegation also met choe thae bok , chairman of north korea 's legislature , the supreme people 's assembly . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although they were not traveling as envoys of u.s. president george w. bush , they were the first american officials to visit since the nuclear standoff began in october . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they flew to seoul on sunday to brief south korean officials on their northern trip . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
north korea said it was developing its nuclear weapons as `` a response to what they saw happened in iraq , with the u.s. removing saddam hussein from power , '' weldon said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
a north korean foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by state - run kcna news agency that the visit helped both sides better understand each other and they shared the view that washington and pyongyang needed to avoid confrontation and exist peacefully . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` they were of the same view that it is necessary to seek a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and expressed their stand that it is necessary to continue seeking and discussing ways of settling it , '' the spokesman said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
north korea has repeatedly accused washington of planing to invade . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
bush says he prefers a diplomatic solution , but has not ruled out a military option . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in seoul , south korean president roh moo -hyun said his government has no `` clear proof '' to conclude north korea has nuclear weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` north korea has told important people of the united states that it has developed nukes and reprocessed spent fuel rods . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but north korea has not confirmed that to anyone else , '' roh said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` thus , we must make a very careful judgment on whether we will conclude it has nuclear weapons or not , based on those words only . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. and south korean officials say that north korea may be bluffing about its nuclear program in an attempt to extract concessions from the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said monday that the threat could n't be ignored . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` certainly what we know suggests that we should take what they ( north korean officials ) are saying very seriously , '' he said at a news conference in seoul . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
weldon said his delegation `` comes away convinced '' that the nuclear standoff can be resolved in a peaceful manner that allows pyongyang 's communist regime to stand while removing its nuclear threats . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roh issued a similar message during a nationally televised news conference . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` south korea and the united states share a firm principle that north korea should never possess nuclear weapons and that the issue should be resolved through a peaceful manner , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roh spoke after meeting the u.s. lawmakers and wolfowitz , who also arrived in seoul on sunday for a two - day visit to discuss north korea . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wolfowitz said saturday in singapore that washington hoped putting pressure on north korea 's battered economy would resolve the nuclear standoff . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on monday , wolfowitz stressed that military readiness was just as important . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in meetings with south korean officials , wolfowitz urged them to increase military spending on new technologies and telecommunications equipment , as u.s. forces have done . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
south korea earmarks about us$ 14.5 billion for its military . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` they still work with paper and pencil instead of with the kind of modern communications gear that our special forces took with them to afghanistan , '' wolfowitz said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said upgrades would allow troops to react quicker to threats from the north and help reduce the possibility of a military conflict on the peninsula , not heighten it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
the nuclear crisis flared last october when u.s. officials said north korea admitted running a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 accord with washington . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
state refused bid to prosecute acquitted apartheid germ warfare head |||O O O O O O O O O O 
south africa 's supreme court of appeal ruled tuesday against a state request to retry the head of apartheid 's germ warfare program , once accused of plotting to poison nelson mandela . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
wouter basson was acquitted in april 2002 on 46 charges , ranging from murder and drug trafficking to fraud and theft . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
basson was accused of directing south africa 's former apartheid regime 's biochemical efforts aimed at destroying its opponents . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
the ruling by judges piet streicher and mohamed navsa of the supreme court of appeal , the highest appeals court in the country , means that basson can not be tried again and his acquittal stands , the south african press association reported . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
the state 's appeal was based on the judge refusing to recuse himself during basson 's 2 1/2 - year trial . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the prosecution alleged presiding judge willie hartzenberg favored basson . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the appeal judges found hartzenberg 's refusal did not relate to an error of law on his part . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
basson headed a program named project coast in the 1980's . |||O O O O O O O O O O O

`` we are not expecting to drive into baghdad suddenly and seize it . '' |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
instead of an all - out assault , analysts expect the united states to follow the example of british forces outside the southern iraqi city of basra . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are likely to mount small probing patrols into the city to determine the level of iraqi resistance . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if these patrols meet little opposition , thousands of troops could rush into the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
if the iraqis respond forcefully , the army and marine units could withdraw and await the 4th mechanized infantry division , which will soon start moving north from kuwait . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
while they wait , the forces would try to determine where iraqi strong points are within the city and where hussein might be , if he is still alive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` the basra model will work for a while , at least until you see problems with food and water for civilians in the city , '' said lawrence korb , an analyst at the council on foreign relations who was assistant defense secretary under former president ronald reagan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` before going in ( with a full assault ) , you have to decide if it 's worth the risks , and ... you have to know who 's there in the way of iraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to iraqi civilians , which makes the british experience around basra instructive , the analysts said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the british have been outside the city of 1.5 million for more than a week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thousands of refugees have fled the city , apparently providing information to the british that has led to raids on military and baath party sites in the city . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
`` the key endgame may be whether the u.s. can parse out the key regime centers of power in baghdad and attack them without having to fight into the city , or at least locate them well enough to atman of the center for strategic and international studies said in his daily war report . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
u.s. strategists say that hussein , if he is still alive and in control of his forces , might like a bloody battle in baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy u.s. casualties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O 
his last hope for survival might be that the united states loses its taste for such losses and forces president bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow hussein and his family to keep power in baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but michael o'hanlon of the brookings institution in washington said the apparent collapse of republican guard resistance could deprive hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` if u.s. forces seriously degrade iraq 's half - dozen republican guard divisions before that final battle , and only have to face perhaps 30,000 special republican guard , fedayeen , and related personnel , the task will not be as hard as it might have been , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while two guard divisions have apparently been smashed , there are three others in the baghdad area . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
a sixth remains in northern iraq . |||O O O O O O O 
cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from the regular iraqi army , which is generally viewed as less reliable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this shows the iraqi military 's growing weakness , he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` the republican guard has taken a massive hammering at every level and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the brigade level , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the iraqis still have n't used chemical weapons , even though many experts feared such attacks as the u.s. troops neared baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
korb , who 's convinced hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never reported to u.n. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
inspectors , said he would n't be surprised if hussein tried to use them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but he also said , `` he may destroy them to embarrass us , '' to show the world he never had such weapons and that bush invaded for no reason other than aggression . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
the u.s. forces zeroing in on baghdad _ the 1st marine division from the east and the army 's 3rd mechanized infantry division _ are trained in urban warfare . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but in such close - quarters fighting , they would lose much of the technological advantage of their air supremacy , which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualties . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
however , baghdad from the air looks like los angeles _ wide , straight boulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` our forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but there would be lots of casualties on all sides , '' korb said . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O

cia says north korea has new nuclear testing site and technology |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. intelligence officials now believe north korea is developing the technology to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit atop the country 's growing arsenal of missides ( potentially putting tokyo and u.s. troops based in japan at risk , according to officials who have received the intelligence reports . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the assessment , which they have shared with japan , south korea and other allies in recent weeks , officials at the central intelligence agency said that u.s. satellites have identified a sophisticated new nuclear testing site in an area called youngdoktong . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the site , equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that , when detonated , could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclear explosion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
[ oma intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testing range is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much more sophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto its growing arsenal of medium - and long - range missiles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
previously , u.s. officials had said they were uncertain whether north korea had received enough outside technical help to even attempt to make such a `` miniaturized '' nuclear warhead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the new testing capability would suggest that the north koreans are getting closer _ now , officials said , the intelligence reports say they could do in in as little as a year or less . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but officials say there is no sure way of knowing that they can until they actually test one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
senior administration officials say that washington has been trying to convince asiagent that it requires a unified diplomatic front to force the country to give up its weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the new intelligence is apparently being marshaled to support the administration 's argument . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
according to officials who have been briefed on the u.s. reports , conventional explosions simulating a nuclear detonation have been set off at the testing site , which is near north korea 's main nuclear complex . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
north korea has never tested a nuclear weapon , though the cia long ago estimated that it manufactured two crude devices in the late 1980s or early 1990s . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
north korea , unlike iraq , has made no secret of its plan to develop nuclear weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , administration officials say they fear that the country is on the verge of producing five or six new weapons , some of which might be miniaturized . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` this would give them the range they never had before , and the chance to spread their threat far beyond south korea , '' said one senior asian official , noting that approximately 60,000 u.s. troops are based in japan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` it changes the dynamics of the problem . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the new intelligence estimates provided to asian allies , however , left it unclear how quickly the north could produce the small warheads . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the worst - case estimate , officials say , is that they could do so in less than a year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. satellites have been watching north korean nuclear activity intently since late last year , when the north evicted international inspectors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
those inspectors had stood guard over a collection of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods , which can be reprocessed into weapons - grade plutonium . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in january the country began to re -start its nuclear rexrogessing equipment , which had been mothballed for nearly a decade under a 1994 agreement with the clinton administration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but according to u.s. officials , it now appears that north korean engineers ran into technical problems in restarting the facilities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while intelligence officials have reached no consensus , they told allies last week that in the worst case , only a few hundred of the 8,000 rods had been converted into plutonium . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it would take 1,000 to 1,500 rods to make enough plutonium for a weapon , experts say .o |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` what we are told is that it would take perhaps six months after that to produce a miniaturized warhead , and put it into one of the missiles , '' said one senior official who has recently reviewed the intelligence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` but after iraq , who knows how good those estimates are ? '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after the claims made about prohibited weapons in iraq , which have not been found so far , skepticism about the quality of u.s. intelligence is widespread . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and in the case of north korea , as in iraq , the immediacy of the threat depends on whose analysis seems most compelling . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so far , u.s. intelligence has picked up almost no sign of the telltale krypton gas that is released into the atmosphere when nuclear fuel rods are converted into weapons - grade plutonium . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this has led some analysts to argue that the north koreans may be farther from producing a weapon than feared a few months ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but others note that trucks were seen carrying the rods out of their normal storage area months ago , and it is unclear where they are _ or even whether the united states is sniffing for the krypton gas in the right place . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` we do n't believe that the main reprocessing facility has been very active , '' said one senior administration official in a recent interview . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` but could there be a second reprocessor ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
no one knows for sure . '' |||O O O O O O O 
without question , though , north korea 's capabilities greatly outstrip anything iraq has had in the past decade , and north korea 's program is probably several years ahead of iran 's . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
president bush and south korea 's new president , roh moo -h is unclear whether they interpret the meaning of that phrase the same way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush has said he wants a diplomatic solution to the problem , but would not foreclose any option , including military options . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
roh has said any pre-emptive strike against the north 's nuclear facilities could prove disastrous . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O

" the key is that iraq in the end should be governed by the iraqi people , " blair said , pledging that british and us forces would not stay in the country " a day longer than necessary " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a " false choice " to debate whether iraq should be run by coalition forces or the united nations , said blair , who was believed to be in favor of a stronger un role in post-conflict iraq than bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
echoing blair , bush said the un would play a role in all aspects of post-war iraq , from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority , adding that iraq would " move as quickly as possible " to an interim authority made up of iraqis from inside and outside the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , when pressed on what precisely the un role would be , bush on tuesday mentioned only humanitarian work , " suggesting " people to staff the interim authority and helping iraq " progress . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" when we say vital role for the united nations , we mean vital role for the united nations in all aspects of the issue , whether it be humanitarian aid , or whether it be helping to stand up an interim authority . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the iraqi people will decide who 's on the iraqi interim authority , " said bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush did not spell out how much power the united nations would have , nor did he elaborate on washington 's plans to place us officials alongside iraqis in the interim administration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
differences still remain between the united states and britain , analysts said , over the speed with which iraq should be handed to an interim iraqi administration , and the extent to which a us - led group of generals and former diplomats should effectively run the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yet , analysts argued , both britain and the united states hope their agreed vision of a postwar scenario will placate anti-war nations such as france , germany and russia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush vowed at the joint news conference with blair , adding that the interim authority would serve until a permanent government could be chosen by the iraqi people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" rebuilding of iraq will require the support and expertise of the international community . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are committed to working with international institutions , including the united nations , which will have a vital role to play in this task , " bush added . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blair also pleaded the world to avoid " endless diplomatic wrangles " over the future of iraq like the international dispute over a second un resolution on iraq that preceded the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
france and germany , which were most vocal in opposing this us - led war against iraq , have been insisting that the united nations should play a central role in the phase of post-war iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the unresolved dispute between europe and the united states , analysts say , blair might again have to make a difficult choice , but he is very likely to support the united states , which britain can not afford to fall out with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hka -- macao traces passengers on flight with suspected sars infector |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
four macao residents have been notified by the health services that they shared the same plane with a taiwanese suspected to have contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) on april 8 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

according to the criminal code , treason is punishable with a possible death penalty . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

philippine government dismisses estrada still - be - president claim |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the philippine presidential palace friday dismissed as an " old tune " deposed leader joseph estrada 's claim that he was still the country 's legitimate president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
presidential chief of staff rigoberto tiglao said estrada 's camp was trying to revive the issue on the legality of president gloria macapagal - arroyo 's administration when this was upheld twice by the supreme court . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" this is an old tune as far as the palace is concerned , " tiglao said hours after estrada petitioned the anti -graft court , the sandiganbayan , to dismiss the government charges against him , citing " lack of jurisdiction " since he was still the president . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
meanwhile , the court shrugged off the claim of estrada 's lawyer alan paguia that its ruling on the legitimacy of the arroyo administration was illegal and cautioned that the tribunal 's decision was final and could not be overturned by the sandiganbayan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

czech president appoints new defense minister |||O O O O O O 
czech president vaclav klaus on monday appointed miroslav kostelka as the country 's new defense minister to replace jaroslav tvrdik who resigned from the post in late may . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
the decision was made in response to the recommendation of prime minister vladimir spidla . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kostelka , 52 , was first deputy defense minister and an ex- general . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
at the end of last month , tvrdik submitted his resignation in protest against planned cuts in defense spending as part of the government 's finance reforms . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
under the planned package of public finance reforms , only 2.05 percent of the country 's gross domestic product ( gdp ) will be allocated for the defense budget . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tvrdik said the military reform could not be completed thoroughly with so little money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tvrdik , who took over the defense ministry in may 2001 , also announced that he would quit his post in the parliament and give up his position in the ruling party social democrats . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
prime minister spidla said monday that the ongoing military reform should continue , with regard to the government 's planned public finance reforms . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the appointment marked the second change of the cabinet post since the spidla - led government came into power in july 2002 . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O 
us pharmaceutical company founder sentenced to 87 months in prison |||O O O O O O O O O O 
sam waksal , founder of the us pharmaceutical company imclone systems was sentenced to 87 months in prison tuesday for insider trading . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
waksal was also ordered to pay more than 4 million dollars in fines and back taxes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
this order came after about two hours ' legal proceedings at the manhattan courthouse in new york , according to a tv report . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
before the sentence , there had been speculations among analysts on whether waksal would get leniency because his company has been working on researches of cancer drugs , a good endeavor in the eyes of many people . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
imclone 's erbitux drug has been recently accepted to be effective in helping cancer patients . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the order just released from the courthouse in new york has obviously separated waksal 's good efforts in making new drugs from his legal problems . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
amid the financial storms last year and the ensuing cracking down on corporate malfeasance , waksal pleaded guilty in october to charges involving his efforts to sell a huge block of his company ' s stock in late 2001 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the attempt to sell the shares were just before imclone shares plunged on the news that the food and drug administration rejected imclone 's application to sell the experimental cancer drug , erbitux . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this incident then triggered legal investigations , which also included the case of a us media and domestic design diva , martha stewart . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eu backs stricter nuclear inspections in iran |||O O O O O O O

a statement issued at the two - day meeting of the eu foreign ministers called on iran to conclude and implement urgently and unconditionally an additional protocol to the nuclear non - proliferation treaty allowing for short - notice inspections of suspected nuclear sites in the country . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it said that the eu was seriously concerned about iran 's nuclear activities and urged it to cooperate fully with the iaea . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" this would be a significant step in demonstrating iran 's stated peaceful intentions with regard to its nuclear program , " the seven - point statement said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
george papandreou , foreign minister of greece , the current holder of the eu presidency , said he was in personal contact with iaea director-general mohamed elbaradei and would follow his lead on this matter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eu foreign ministers reiterated that improved trade links with iran should be conditional on iran 's cooperation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they also said that the eu was closely following the nuclear issue and would revert it to the forthcoming debate of the iaea meeting on tuesday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O

tiglath 31 jan 2005 10:40:52 - 0800 re : good morning iraq |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there two main qualities to be desired in a commander - in - chief , generalship and leadership . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because in the united states the commander - in - chief is a purely political post , generalship is usually undertaken by the generals proper under the commander - in - chief , provided it is understood that the commander - in - chief is ultimately responsible and accountable for the outcomes of his general 's generalship . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
generalship involves the technical skills of intelligence gathering , strategic and tactical planning , and the communication of orders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
leadership can be less rigidly defined and is concerned less with coordination than motivation and how a commander seeks to inspire his men to fight harder and endure worse privations in order to beat the enemy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
president bush generalship has proven deficient . |||O O O O O O O 
his planning for the war was inadequate and his monitoring of the war after the invasion failed to correct course in the face of the change in circumstances brought by a strong and unexpected insurgency . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the commander - in - chief 's generalship can suffice to motivate men if they are higly confident that he is a very capable and skilled general . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eisenhower was in that position . |||O O O O O O 
that has not been the case with president bush , who unleashed hell acting on faulty intelligence , failed to find any wmd , and left our boys at war wanting for armor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is not the sort of generalship that on rational grounds alone motivates men to march to possible death . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
men unmotivated by bad generalship can still be motivated by exceptional leadership . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in theory , motivation is best carried out by a commander fighting alongside his men . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
make no mistake , even when we do n't desire a president with a preference for personal combat , the need for a commander to be seen to share dangers with his men is as imperative today as it was in times of alexander of macedon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's why we look at the military record of our leaders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john kennedy , george h. bush , and even john kerry , the loser , had distinguished military careers that were apt substitutes for leading men in battle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the knowledge that the commander - in - chief once faced grave danger in war bravely can be the animating spirit of troops facing the same dangers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
george w. bush has no distinguished military career . |||O O O O O O O O O 
in fact , cbs and carrier landings notwithstanding , there is every indication that in the peak of youth he avoided the dangers of war as much as he could . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone motivates men to march to possible death . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some might say that george w. bush is neither a general nor a soldier , he is a politician . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he is in charge of grand strategy and he delegates the rest . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but as commander - in - chief he is the ultimate general and the first soldier . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
george w. bush , the politician , is not very good at grand strategy either . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the aim of grand strategy is a prosperous and secure peace , and by his several blunders over the psychology of his opponents , the political and economic effects of his actions , and the failure to erradicate terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist , george w. bush , he has failed to realize the aim of grand strategy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'll be glad if iraq becomes a truly democratic country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are you willing to pay with a deficit of billions , thousands of americans dead or badly wounded , and the unmeasurable disruption that a foreign war causes to the life of our nation at all levels , for each country in the world that is in the grip of a tyrant ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
let those countries grow a generation with the guts and the willingness to originate democratic change and i 'll support joining other nations to back the ef . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but unilaterally , or worse leading a coalition featuring tyrannies , effect such change remains a bad idea , iraq 's elections notwithstanding . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
george w. bush did n't do well in the industrial private sector where success is measured by return on investment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
government suits such a man perfectly ; there is no balance sheet to worry about . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there is every indication that the new rulers of iraq will do business as usual under a democratic varnish . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the interim government did n't hesitate to torture opponents , just like saddam did . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

she is saying she 's a member of the uacc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have contacted the uacc and told them about it so they can check the auctions ( she 's been doing this a long time ) and to tell me if she 's actually a registered member . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you see her name , stay clear . |||O O O O O O O O O 
no matter which id she 's using . |||O O O O O O O O 
also , i have seen in the past , others reselling items usuing her coa 's . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i am miffed the uacc would not check into people before allowing them to be members if in fact she is a member . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i will reserve judgement till they respond . |||O O O O O O O O O 
this makes one really skeptical . |||O O O O O O 
but if you see a uacc member on ebay , do n't automatically assume they are legit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
contact the uacc before buying and ask if they are a member . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you suspect something is fake , do not take it for granted it 's legit because a uacc number is attached to it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

on the other hand , if you were a scientist at noaa and were into saving people from tsunamis , you would think you might have figured out beforehand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of such an event . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also , the indonesian government probably had no idea that noaa could give them advanced warning of tsunamis so how could they know they should set up a hotline . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it cuts both ways , the indonesian government should have done some prior planning , but so too should the noaa scientists . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can bet they are figuring out who they should have call next time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

since they knew he had it , that 's probably why she 's not questioning this issue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one of the hallmarks of a good totalitarian leader is the tendency to jump into a military uniform at the drop of a hat ( although stuffing socks in your crotch while doing it is an innovation apparently dreamed up by george w. bush ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
another is to make sure there are plenty of very big pictures of yourself all over the place . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
fortunately for our great leader he does n't have to do this himself , because he 's got one of the biggest media companies in the country to do it for him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
clear channel - home to rush limbaugh and sean hannity - owns over 1,200 radio stations and 57 television stations in america . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they also own a lot of billboards . |||O O O O O O O O 
want to know what they do with their billboards when nobody 's paying to use them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the picture was taken off i - 4 north of downtown orlando by duer davhill . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the text at the bottom reads , " not authorized by any candidate or candidate 's committee . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a political public service message brought to you by clear channel . " |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
did you know that one of the largest media companies in the country was in the business of bringing you " political public service messages ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
truth be told we originally thought that this picture was fake , but we had to eat crow when clear channel released a statement which read in part , " clear channel outdoor markets are operated locally . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
local managers determine what copy to use when a location has time that is not sold to an advertiser . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that statement was made after clear channel denied the billboard existed , of course . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
florida 's not the only state to suffer clear channel 's " political public service messages " by the way - check out this one from arizona : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

bush administration quietly stops destroying chemical and biological weapons |||O O O O O O O O O 
unnoticed by anyone else , the bush administration has quietly ditched programs to destroy america 's biggest - in - the - world stockpile of chemical and biological weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
eight places in the us are used to stockpile chemical weapons -- including blister agents , riot agents , and the dreaded nerve agents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in these eight locations , hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds , bombs , and rockets are stacked in both open and bunker storage , some of them leaking their contents and all of the very deadly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
storage locations include : -- anniston army depot , anniston , al -- rocky mountain arsenal , pueblo , co -- bluegrass army depot , lexington , ky |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
-- aberdeen proving grounds , md |||O O O O O O 
-- toelle army depot , toelle , ut ( the granddaddy of them all ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
destruction is underway in anniston where the dept of defense built and is operating an incinerator to burn weapons located there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
plans were underway to build destruction facilities at all other locations but now the bush junta has removed from its proposed defense budget for fiscal year 2006 all but the minimum funding for these destruction projects . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
plans to destroy chemical weapons are now stopped , except for a small test program at toelle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
contractors ( bechtel was the main contractor ) have been told to stop all design and construction work and the re-assign their people -- the destruction programs are dead . ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
can anyone spell " w. m . d. " ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
can anyone tell me which nation in the world owns the most wmd ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( hint : it 's neither iraq , iran , nor north korea -- none of the famous " axis of evil . " ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you do n't suppose they have stopped destroying these weapons because they plan to use them ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

two of my nephews were excluded from their brother 's wedding this weekend because they are not lds . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
of interest , neither went to the reception either . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
both were extremely hurt , particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
i was offended because one of those nephews and i are very close , and he was really upset . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the groom said " it was n't quite what i had expected . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the bride is not quite able to speak in front of strangers , so i do n't know what she thought . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she did tell my niece that she thought her husband was a good catch -- rm attending byu and all that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i got a sort of an icky feeling when i realized the only people who did attend the kid 's wedding was his unmedicated bi-polar mother and his father , who suffers from alzheimers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : the old wedding problem |||O O O O B-TRI O 
i really think it 's time for the church to admit that a civil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal , often in a more loving way , than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a change of that sort would be very simple to implement , and most church members would like it better than allowing non -lds family members into the temple , which would actually be my preference . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's been a thread recently in one of the exmo fora about a woman whose bishop , who she had been planning to have marry her , was going out of town , so she asked the stake president , who she did n't know well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he insisted that he needed to make the point , as part of performing the ceremony , that she really needed to be married in the temple , even though her fiance was not lds . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she ultimately declined his services . |||O O O O O O 
how to get the message across to young people that considering the feelings of their family is just as important as being sealed for time and all eternity ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it would have to be some sort of grassroots movement , i think , since it 's not likely to come through official , correlated channels . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

* shrugs * i chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and i were both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both families completely . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
from a family standpoint it sounded liek a good decision , harmony and all that ... plus the temple ceremony could be sealed a year later . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasons and the marriage did n't last . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i ca n't help but wonder if perhaps we did ourselves a diservice by not getting sealedi ntially , and making our marriage a gospel focused one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a tough decision to make and despite the feeling i myself caved i feel people should be understanding of the rationale . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for my part if we had been sealed intially there simply would n't have been anyone there and both our families had harsh feeligns about the church as is , and a sealign would have only created more disharmony . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for my part though , i think we started the marriage with a compromise and deined ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately paid the price . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : the old wedding problem |||O O O O O O 
i wonder how many success stories are out there from people who chose to have a civil ceremony , and went on later to be happily sealed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know that was what happened with my own parents , largely because their decision to get married and my father 's decision to join the church came very close together , and they did n't want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

dogbirdh...@yahoo.com 13 jan 2005 09:51:33 - 0800 divorce is really stupid ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think divorce is really stupid . |||O O B-TRI O O O O 
it 'll take me awhile to get to thought stream that got me to that thought today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
first off , i 'm remarried , divorced 3 years ago . |||O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O 
i love my wife , and the kids get along just fine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't like my exwife . |||O O O O O O O 
but there was a time when i did like her ; in fact i loved her very much in spite of her numerous flaws , chief among those flaws is that she 's a narcicists . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but we all have some sort of personality problems .... |||O O O O O O O O O O 
my wife belongs to a support group , and just for fun , they all googled their hubbies ex's . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
somehow , this lead me to googling my ex's boyfriend , call him b . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and there he was , talking about plans with his wife and kids . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to me , b was just this one dimensional guy that was being dragged along by my exwife . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , he turns out to have a 3 dimensional life too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i guess we all do . |||O O O O O O 
i 'd like to take him out for a beer sometime . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i wonder what happenned to b 's son ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
my kids never mentioned b having a son . |||O O O O O O O O O 
b 's son is apparently 16 years old , same age as my daughter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i wonder if b had a huge messy divorce , and his ex took the kid out of state . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
i have my kids almost 50 / 50 these days , but it was a huge messy post divorce compromise that took a year to complete . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
i wonder if b had to go through some of the same kind of shit ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
perhaps my exwife has more sympathy for what it s like to be a guy on the receiving end of a divorce now ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
oh my , the plot thickens . |||O O O O O O O 
she wrote an article about a divorce support group , ending it with something about mrs . b being happily married but she 's impressed by the divorce support group . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
and that was only 4 years ago ! |||O O O O O O O O 
mr. and mrs . b had a real life too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they shared dreams together , raised a kid , and probably had a lot of fun together . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now i 'm even more curious about the b 's kid . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she still lives in town here . |||O O O O O O O 
maybe there was some sort of terrible tragedy ??? |||O O O O O O O O O 
i 'll have to ask about b 's kid when my own kids switch off next week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensionally . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
either it s bad or good . |||O B-TRI O O O O O 
i know my first marriage had a lot of good adventures , a lot of friendship , a lot of love . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh , yeah , it was n't perfect . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
my exwife is a total pain in the ass much of the time , and i tried to let her do what she wanted , sometimes i could n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , even to the end , we loved each other . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now , i see the lost family ties . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
she 's lost my family , i 'm slowly drifting out of touch with her family . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we both build new lives . |||O O O O O O 
but you know , as long as the kids are shared , you ca n't total get this exspouse out of your mental psyche . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they say it takes one year for every two that you were married . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
my wife 's name is m . we 're going to a bed and breakfast this weekend , to get away , relax . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
m and i are slowly building a history of our own together . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we share adventures together , we share adventure with my kids , and with our dogs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , i take lots of pictures . |||O O O O O O O O 
i really have n't changed very much from who i was before . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although , the dog thing is really post divorce . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
lots and lots of pictures . |||O O O O O O 
sometimes i look at the old photos , before divorce . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
we smiled together , laughed , hugged . |||O O O O O O O O 
i was one of the first digital camera users , and i have too many photos from my first marriage . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
sometimes i feel like i 'm racing to create enough photos of my new life to outweigh the long history of my first life . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's going to take awhile ... |||O O O O O O O 
luckily , we flawed human beings live long lives , and digital cameras take lots and lots of pictures ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if my exwife does n't dump b , maybe they 'll wind up staying together , maybe even getting married . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
i think that would be nice . |||O O O O O O O 
and they too will begin the process of rebuilding their " together " lives . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm assuming there is some humanity beneath my exwife 's narcicistic shell , but i do believe there is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
b seems like a decent enough person too . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so , b and my ex will be doing the same thing that i 'm doing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyway , all of this gets me back to my original point . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
divorce seems really really stupid . |||B-TRI O O O O O 
it seems to me , that beneath it all , we all want the same things . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
love , companionship , and a partner for our life 's journies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
none of this makes total sense to me . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but i just thought i 'd ramble . |||O O O O O O O O

re : divorce is really stupid ... |||O O O O O O O 
your post made me horribly sad . |||O O O O O O O 
my ex has that nice new life with the child - bride and the 2 cats and 2 dogs and new house and my son primarily lives with them even though he ends up being at my place 1 / 2 the time in a 2 - week period . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i live in a 961 sq. ft. apartment . |||O O O O O O O O O 
my ex has most all of the photos as our son lives there and it 's his history . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did get a good bunch of the wedding photos , but my ex refused to give them all to me saying it was " his life too " even though i really resent them being under the same roof with his child - bride . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm sure they are taking lots of pictures of their trips / vacations /whatever ( at least 2 that i know of ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't own a camera . |||O O O O O O O 
his new inlaws are all former family friends |||O O O O O O O O 
i do n't have anything to do with anymore for obvious reasons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
his family ( brother , sister , stepmother ) conveniently seem to forget that for almost 20 years i was a member of their family . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there was no gradual " drifting of out touch " despite the fact that we all live in the same city and my ex |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bil and i even work within blocks of each other . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
my family thinks my ex is pond scum but because my parents are still members at the same church , they have to see my ex and his new wife every week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my mother took his remarriage harder than i did , i think , because of that . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
especially for those of us who still have so many years ( if one year for every 2 married , then i 've still got another 7 or so ) to go to get our heads screwed back on and find some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has or what you and your ex have . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i agree that the buyer probably did n't read the credit terms to find themselves with an unexpected rate ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i always see that " for qualified customers " in all of their advertisements that probably releases them of any wrong doing ... but i also believe in the court systems so let it take its course and see what happens . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the only tort reform that i think should be done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action suits . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions ... but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O

gateway advertised and stickered many of its 486 computers as " pentium ready " , meaning that a special type 3 zif socket pentium overdrive could be installed and run . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

then intel changed the pentium overdrive , and the final version had a write - back cache . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when installed in a gateway system , the chip ran slower than slow , maybe about as fast as an ibm at , and bus - mastering devices like nics and scsi cards refused to work . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so the lawyers sued gateway , and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of gateway 486 computers . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the coupon was good for $ 50 off on the purchase of a pentium overdrive processor from gateway , at its usual inflated prices !!! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what does a discount coupon for a processor i ca n't use in my system do for me ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i wonder how many people gleefully cashed in their coupons and bought pentium overdrives from gateway . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
intel eventually compensated by making available an " interposer " , a little socketed thingie installed between the pentium overdrive and the zif socket . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the sole purpose of the interposer was to raise a signal on the cpu to force it s cache to operate in the write - thru mode which was compatible with most zif socket 3 486 motherboards . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
needless to say , this was the least successful " overdrive " cpu ever done by intel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the 486 - dx4 overdrive was ok , as were several socket 5 pentium overdrives and the socket 8 pentium pro overdrive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
finally intel gave up on overdrives ... |||O O O O O O O

believe it or not there are companies that go over the line and need to be hit with a stick called a law suit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the government sure does n't have the resources or desire to pursue them so it 's left to the private sector to protect themselves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the only people who profit from class actions are the lawyers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
since companies are going to be sued in class action , regardless of the merits of the case , the threat of a class action is not a detriment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you do n't believe that , witness the vioxx lawsuits . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the company making vioxx determined it might increase mortality and pulled it from the market . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because of that , it is being sued . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the companies making similar drugs ( celebrex and bextra ) did not pull their product from the market . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are not being sued . |||O O O O O O 
doing the right thing provides no protection from class action . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
all class actions do is enrich lawyers and raise costs to everyone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the cost of class actions is factored into the cost of everything you buy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've heard mostly positive things about how the red cross is handling their donations , with a very high percentage of the donated funds going directly for relief and not for administrative expenses . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so that is the channel we chose for our own donation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of going directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the red cross normally deducts 9 % from all deductions for its administratice costs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it has announced that it will forego the 9 % on donations earmarked for tsunami relief and that 100 % of these funds will go directly toward aid . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
9 % in administrative costs would place the red cross among charity organizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the figure for most charities is 10 - 16 % . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know what negative stories about the red cross you have heard . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but nothing is 100 % and no organization of any kind is perfect . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just because of its size , which dwarfs most other charities , i would assume that the red cross may be responsible for proportionately more blunders than most other charitable organizations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as tragic as the earthquake and tsunami in south asia have been , it is truly uplifting to see how so many people have opened their hearts and so generously responded to the call for help toward disaster relief efforts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
money from private donations has been flowing into charitable relief organizations at an unprecedented rate , in some cases by millions of dollars per hour . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" tsunami aid " was the fourth most frequently used term used in internet searches last week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although the need for help is still continuing , some individual charities have announced that they have already received as much in donations as they can put to use for this effort . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the following announcement was received from msf |||O O O O O O O 
" doctors without borders / médecins sans frontières ( msf ) has received an extraordinary outpouring of support for the people of south asia and we are extremely grateful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as you know , it is very important to msf that we use your contribution as you intend it to be used . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is why we want to let you know that at this time , msf estimates that we have received sufficient funds for our currently foreseen emergency response in south asia . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've read that too - unfortunate , because i 've worked with them in rwanda and was very impressed with the professionalism of their organization . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so they did n't discourage donations to them per se , just not for this specific area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course i realize that most people will want to help where the need for it is the most immediate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in q he 's in charge of the car from the moment he attempts to put the key in the door lock . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if he 's asleep in the back seat with the keys in his possession then he 's the person in charge of the car . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the offence is being drunk in charge of a vehicle -- as distinct from being drunk while operating a vehicle ( which is a separate offence ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you 're below .05 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the standard ruse is to throw the keys under the car after you 've unlocked the door ( which you can later claim was unlocked by a person unknown ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in this case the offender escaped conviction first time around because it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys , which supposedly landed in his lap . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sure , no reasonable cop would do that , but just strictly talking from the law side of things . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : the pain of childbirth |||O O O O O O 
if you go for a home birth you can rent a birthing pool . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would n't necessaritly say that you will have a repeat labour ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my first labour i was 30 hours and had an epidural after 22 hours . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
# 2 i went in saying " give me the epidural asap - and never got to the state where i felt that i needed it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
only had tens and gas - and - air . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
so do n't give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think different people / different labours are different , so just because one person says " i did *** and it did n't hurt a bit " does n't mean that it will work for someone else , so going in with a set of suggestions , and being prepared to try them and see which is the best is probably the most helpful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

johnq.public thu , 02 dec 2004 16:48:31 - 0500 waiver of extradition means what |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
my girlfriend was on the run from probation in fla when she got herself in trouble here in az . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
which apparantly , true to her habits , she tried to avoid by not showing up for court . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
time goes by , we meet etc etc she gets herself under the scrutiny of the police and into jail again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
fla trouble 1999 she signed a waiver of extradition as part of her plea deal |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
az in trouble in 2001 , fla is mentioned and she signs another waiver of extradition , posts bonds and skips ( not far enough apparantly ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
az troubles again in 2004 , she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az , fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open ( she failed miserably at probation ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think they want to give her 3 years . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
my question isa this , what the heck is a waiver of extradition good 4 ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how will her probation be affected here ? |||O O O O O O O O 
i ask around locally and no one will reply , not her public defender , the public defenders office , so i guess this is my last resource cuase i can not afford to consult with an attorney . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thanks in advance , mlm the guy who shoulda known better ............. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : waiver of extradition means what |||O O O O B-TRI O O 
the waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state , she ca n't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction , and that the court wo n't have to initiate the time - consuming process of extraditing her . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
instead , if the cops pick her up , she can be shipped back without delay . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : waiver of extradition means what |||O O O O O O O 
she 's going to have a lot of separate offenses to account for by this time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
2 " fta " s ( failure to appear ) , one in fl and one in az , plus whatever the original charges were in both cases . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that means she has given up the right to force the fl authorities to go thru legal due process in demanding that the az authorities turn her over to them for further prosecution . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all the fl prosecutors have to do is ask , and the az jailers will pack her up in a van or a plane and ship her back to fl for trial on the fta charge and probably to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went along with her original probation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she 's in deep sh__t if you have n't already figure that out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nowhere in usa would be far enough if she waived extradition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's what her waiver of extradition meant they could do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they let her serve her time in az , then they come and get her to serve her time in fl . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is what happens when people blow off the chances they are given to straighten out by being given probation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thumb your nose at the court often enough , and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head , re-instituting the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the fta . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what is it good for ? |||O O O O O O 
it 's good for the state , not for the convict . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it let s them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to , in order to ship her from one state to another . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation ; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right , they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she would n't have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she does n't have a lot of leeway here . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
she has done this numerous times and they are not likely to give her another wide open chance like they did the first 3 times . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she will probably have to serve out her sentence in fl , and if she has not already served all her time in az , they will then ship her back there to do that time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
waitaminit , you said she does have a public defender ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
ok , he / she is doing all they can , but that 's not much , under the circumstances . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 're complaining that you ca n't get an atty ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and her attys will not talk to you because you are not entitled to participate in their confidential communications with their client . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but wo n't your gf tell you these things ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
if not , maybe it 's because she does n't want you to know either . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
which you would then take into account in deciding if you still want her to be your significant other . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

question regarding simple assault & battery |||O O O O O O 
my roommate was hospitalized in mid-november for lung surgery and spent several days on loads of pain medication . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the fourth day of his stay , he was moved out of the icu to the step - down unit , with a diagnosis of " icu psychosis secondary to narcotic administration " and post thoracostomy . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was confused , because of the medication but was not aggressive or threatening in any manner . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i saw him each day and as soon as we spoke , he became oriented and was perfectly fine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this was witnessed by both the nursing staff and his doctors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
during the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day , he got up , dressed , pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic , to our apartment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
by the time he got to our home , he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who told me " he 's crazy and just walked out . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i sat him down on the couch and talked to him , and asked him what had happened . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he said he 'd asked for something for pain and they told hime he could n't have anything . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then the orderly was apparently rude to him , and that 's when he got up and decided to come home . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a short time later , two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he went back with the officers , gave them no problems at all . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i received a call from the shift supervisor who told me they 'd replaced his chest tube , given him some pain medication and he was doing much better . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i told her to pass on the other shifts that if he became confused or upset to call me , and i 'd talk to him , and get him settled down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at 2:15 the next morning , i received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been " verbally abusive and aggressive " and would i come over and talk to him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , i went over there , getting to his room right at 2:30 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there were two cops there and i asked what had happened . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my roommate was in bed , sound asleep , and had all of his clothes on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a nurse said , " he beat two of us up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the cops are here because we 're pressing charges . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've lived with this man 9 years and never in that time have i ever seen him be aggressive , violent or abusive in anyway . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i asked to speak to the two nurses whom he 'd alledgedly hit and was told i could n't do that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
an hour or so passed and the got my roommate out of bed , took his chest tube out and discharged him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was sent to another hospital with a psych unit until his psychosis resolved . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery , then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was given a copy of a different citation , but with the identical information from the one i 'd gotten the night of the incident . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the police report has the victim saying she was " choked to where she almost lost consciousness , struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks , and that he 'd grabbed her breasts and left marks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
according to the police report , this woman never reported to the er for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my roommate has no recollection of the time from the day before the incident happened until he woke up at the other hospital . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was cited for simple assault and battery . |||O O O O O O O O O 
if there is no evidence , and that includes the belt buckle , how can the county prosecute this case .? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all of his belongings were returned to me upon his discharge , with the exception of the belt buckle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the police do not have it and the hospital does n't know what happened to it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also , i was looking at both citations , i did n't get to the hospital until 2:30 am , and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2:34 am . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
does anyone besides me see a problem with any of this ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what kind of recourse does my roommate have in all of this ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you need an attorney right away . |||O O O O O O O 
you are not going to be able to poke holes in this case with internet advice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in addition , i 's suggest raising the stakes . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
the hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems , and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward , which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sue them for malpractice , and make the number big enough to get some serious attention . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

get a criminal defense lawyer ( i do n't say that very often on this newsgroup ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if your roommate can not afford one , contact your roommate 's parents about paying for one , or ask about getting a court appointed lawyer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tell the lawyer that you will help with the case ( do administrative stuff , etc ) in any way that would help him / her defend your roommate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
north korea has nuclear weapons . |||O O O O O O 
the independent of clackamas county wed , 09 feb 2005 23:32:07 - 0800 north korea has nuclear weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the foreign minister of north korea has state that north korea has nuclear weapons and has officially with drawn from the 6 nation talks on nuclear proliferation in east asia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
the foreign minister also indicated that north korea will continue to develop long range missiles capable of obliterating any target within the borders of the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
according to east asia intelligence sources , north korea has already prepositioned nuclear tipped missiles on freighters and fishing trawlers that are sailing under foreign flags of convenience , that are stationed off the west coast and |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
east coast of the united states . |||O O O O O O O 
missiles launched from these vessels are said to be able to hit 90 % percent of the major cities with in 2 and one half minutes from time of launch . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O

re : north korea has nuclear weapons . |||O O O O O O O O 
well here is the problem that i face and many should be worried about . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if north korea has had nuclear weapons for a few years then they developed them during the clinton administration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the clinton administration also allowed loral to sell missile technology to china , who have been helping pakistan to build their missiles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that technology has undoubtably made it back to north korea ( pakistan , iran and north korea are all working on the same set of missile blue prints ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so now we have north korea with nuclear weapons and workable missiles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also since we missed the boat on north korea and nuclear weapons how can we be sure that iran does n't have nuclear weapons ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the simple and wisest action is to assume that they do have a small number and are working feverishly to build a bigger arsenal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now the nut of the question should be , what if iran gives , sells , provides nuclear weapons to islamic extremists to smuggle into the united states and at 10 am on a wednesday pop 2 or 3 in new york city , destroying wall street , the large banks , the large insurance companies , the large sock brokerage houses and many other world wide financial institutions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the same time 2 weapons go off in washington dc and take out the president , the vice president , 80 senators , and 350 congressmen as well as the department of the treasury , interior , health and welfare , justice , commerce and the federal court system . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then just for yucks lets assume that one goes off at the pentagon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now what do we do ? |||O O O O O O 
remember all your pension funds are now gone . |||O O O O O O O O O 
all your investments are gone . |||O O O O O O 
all the bank records are gone . |||O O O O O O O 
no more government payments for federal employees . |||O O O O O O O O 
no more government payments for aid to schools , environment , police , courts , well fare , etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the dollar is now worthless on the international market . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
with a worthless dollar the amount of fuel available is not cut by 80 % . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no more cheap imports of clothes , boots , appliances , computer stuff , communications equipment , generators , electric motors cars , trucks etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
massive unemployment as we are now in a service economy with nothing to service . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
does the word teotwawki have any meaning . |||O O O O O O O O 
oh i expect to things to hang together for a few weeks as local , county , and state governments try to hold things together , but they wo n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with out fuel to move food stuffs from the farms to food manufactures to local warehouses food stuffs will dry up with in a few week or so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with out fuel to move imported stuff ( most of what we buy these days ) from the ports of entry to local warehouses and local retailer shelves of items like building materials , tools , and every thing else we buy the shelves will be empty in a month or so . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course the above does not take into account that people driven by fear do n't riot and loot every thing in site in the first week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the attack should happen in the winter , no natural gas from canada to heat homes , or fire steam driven electrical generators . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course we could convert back to coal but it will take a couple of weeks to convert them to coal but then how do you get the coal from the mines to the power plants ??? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with no social security or pension payments , aid to dependent children and other government payments , food stamps , ( which are all checks and vouchers ) , and there are no banks to cash them , ( they got all wiped out in the new york financial destruction remember ) no body will accept them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no the situation does n't look good from where i sit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oh we can work on the assumption that the mullahs of iran will be rational , ( but how rational are people who train and fund suicide bombers ) and a rational kim junk ill ( who lets large numbers of his people starve to death every year so he can have nuclear weapons ) kidnaps japanese citizens to teach english , kidnaps movie stars so he can have private performances etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

was the trustee informed of the transfer of the shares ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge , the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
if the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trustee did nothing about them , then you may be ok ; however , if you failed to inform the trustee , then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets , which would , at the minimum , invalidate his discharge . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even if the transfer does n't invalidate the whole discharge , the distribution might be subject to forfeiture to pay creditors ' claims if you failed to inform the trustee of the share transfer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : s corp profit distribution and bankrupcy . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
yes , but according to the facts you first gave , he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
i believe you had said that you gave him the shares in february 2004 but that the discharge did n't come until june of 2004 . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy , which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a bankruptcy case does n't close until you get the discharge order , and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing about it , you are more likely than not ok , but if the trustee was n't informed of the fact directly , then you may be in trouble . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if , however , your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court , then as a general matter the creditors can not go after the shares , unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them ( e.g. , by putting his assets in the corporation 's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O

you do well to wonder why the btk killer was not captured until yesterday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the informal speculation is that the wichita police department was not up to the task . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- one of the btk killer 's victims lived on the same street as the killer |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- the btk killer once called up a police dispatcher and told her of the crime he just committed , and still they could not catch him |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- the btk killer was a known nitpicker and nuissance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is actually a indicator in profiles of serial killers and mastermind terrorists . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- the btk killer was only found out when his daughter recognized certain traits and turned in her dna , which was a close match to the dna on file for her father . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
like in the case of the unibomber , if it was n't for the foresight and charity of a relative , the btk killer would still be loose . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was once reading how a criminal was being tracked in washington , dc , and how he escaped a police dragnet several times , once by taking a taxi . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
though there are very brave police , to a large extent the police have no incentive to capture a criminal , just to stay out of harm 's way and to collect facts after the fact . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you get out on parole , what happens then , and how long does it last ? |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O

getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so you 're basically free , with the expectation that you will not leave the state ( assuming you 've been jailed by the state go v't ) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis ( i think they give you a schedule ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i * believe * you are also expected to get a job , housing , etc. and report this also . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in some cases you may be referred to a specific ' halfway ' house for reintroduction into society , and provided with a simple job . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as for how long it lasts , i would say that it lasts for the rest of your sentence , but i 'm not sure about that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also , you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave , or call a taxi i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not just state-specific , judge ( jury ) - specific and case- specific . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for some reason , i ca n't recall if selling drugs to minors qualifies as a jury trial or what . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but these decisions are entirely up to the judge / jury , and the decision is usually made in regard to the character of the defendant . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is all based on my experience in new york . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
you have to provide a planned residence when you 're considered for parole , usually a relative or program of some kind . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it lasts as long as the rest of your sentence lasts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole , for a period of time up until your sentence runs out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
parole is not a right and it s granting is discretionary . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

indeed , new york 's statute says , " discretionary release on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is a reasonable probability that , if such inmate is released , he will live and remain at liberty without violating the law , and that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so deprecate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law .

here on the left edge of the country , we have a unique perspective on election standards . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
in iraq , an election takes place in which one of the three major forces vying for control of the country opts out . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a few people will turn out and elect somebody . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
it is hailed as the greatest triumph of democracy since the defeat of imperial japan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in washington state , our governor 's race may be undecided for months to come . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
following the election and recount process exactly as outlined in our state constitution , the democratic candidate won by a margin of less than 200 votes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
with roughly three million votes cast in the race , the margin of victory was a few ten thousands of one percent or some such microscopic amount . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for all intents and purposes it was a tie - but somebody had to end up with a few more votes and this time around it was the demos . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the same group of people who have said " even if some regions are too unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome , some election is better than no election , and it 's a great day for democracy ! " ........... are suing to overthrow the results of the governor 's election is washington state because there were some " errors " in the process . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

any old process halfway resembling an election is just diddly dandy in iraq , but we wo n't accept the results of a free and fair election in washington state because there may have been a human error rate of 0.0000001 percent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sorry about my hard ass attitude ! |||O O O O O O O 
the us soldiers were purposely kept well away from the polls during the time the polls were open . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they were the outer of three concentric security rings , with the iraqi police and army occupying the closest two rings . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i watched a lot ( but not all , of course ) of the news on most of the different channels , staying up until 5 am ( like a real dummy ! ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did n't see one instance of us soldiers at polling places . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i * did * see a lot of iraqi soldiers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
except for the us flag on the shoulder and the different weapons , they look pretty much the same . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

ot : new stuff on us election fraud us election fraud : whisper growing to a roar |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
now a person stating he is republican insider is blowing the whistle , indicating that the fraud was much greater than just a handful of votes in ohio and florida . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the ukraine has nothing on it . |||O O O O O O O 
according to this person kerry won decisively not only in ohio and florida but also in a number of other states and in the overall popular vote . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he says he knows how the fraud was worked . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
could this be why so many in the bush gang have been jumping ship ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how will it affect the two snivellers john howard and tony blair if the whistleblowing becomes as insistent as it did over the far , far lesser offences of richard nixon or the personal indiscretions of bill clinton ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

voter fraud in florida and ohio : |||O O O O O O O 
won the election by at least 1,7 million votes |||O O O O O O O O O

i work for the rnc [ republican national committee ] . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i fear reprisals if i 'm found out . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the truth about this election is this : florida and ohio had to go for bush in order for him to " win " the election . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
in reality he lost both states . |||O O O O O O O 
in fact , he did not even win the popular vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he lost the national popular vote by at least 1,750,000 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
this shows you the scale of the fraud . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the exit polls were not wrong . |||O O O O O O O 
kerry was the clear winner , but victory was snatched from him . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
the 200,000 + margin of victory for bush made this state uncontestable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
everybody assumes that even with some fraud , kerry could never have made up the difference in a recount . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but kerry actually won by about 750,000 votes . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the numbers were changed by a computer program ( in both electronic and scan - tron voting systems ) called " kerrylite . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" " kerrylite " of course is not actual name of the program . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the actual name is 11-5 - 18 - 18 etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
for additional encryption , the numbers were jumbled but i 'm not sure in which order . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the numbers replace the letters of the alphabet . |||O O O O O O O O O 
for example , k is the eleventh letter of the alphabet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so the if - then statement goes something like this : " if total true kerry ) total true bush , bush x 1.04 x ( .04 is a random number ) ( total true kerry ) , total true bush " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the second part of the equation takes the total number of votes cast and subtracts the new bush total , subtracts the third party totals and leaves the rest for kerry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sometimes the program would also reduce third party votes and award them to bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and even where bush legitimately won , he was still awarded additional votes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the big democratic counties ( broward for example ) went to kerry because it had to appear that everything was on the up and up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's interesting to see this unfold . |||O O O O O O O O 
does anybody wonder why the republican counties were mostly counted after the democratic counties ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you should wonder , and also know that this was no accident . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the bush team had to make up the votes as the night went on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in ohio , computer voting fraud , vote tossing and voter suppression were the main methods . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
vote tossing was simply the removal of kerry votes and some third party votes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in some areas , the bush vs. kerry votes were absurd . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nine to one , eight to two . |||O O O O O O O O 
voter suppression took the form of making voters stand in four hour long lines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this of course took place in democratic areas . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the simplest thing to do was to have too few voting machines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sometimes that 's all it takes . |||O O O O O O O 
people eventually lose patience and leave without casting a vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
in other states such as new mexico , nevada , iowa and new hampshire , kerry 's leads evaporated very quickly once the polls were shut down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kerry only won new hampshire , but barely . |||O O O O O O O O O 
as it turned out , the lead was 6 % for kerry in that state and not enough fraudulent activity took place to flip the state to bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so this will all come out and be known to everyone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nothing this massive can be kept a secret . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you 're already beginning to see these " irregularities " and the whisper will become a roar . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i really could n't believe what i was watching while bush put medals on talent , franks and bremer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
talent was in charge of the cia when two of the most costly intelligence failures in american history happened -- not recognizing the sept. 11 plot , and wrongly claiming that saddam had a stockpile of wmds . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even people who mindlessly defend bush 's policies , like wjb67 , do n't want to take responsibility for talent -- they point out that he was originally appointed by clinton . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in , take over iraq , and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point i think we 're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and bremer decided to destroy the existing iraqi army , leaving it up to us and new recruits to try to impose order . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is just one more of those wierd , through - the - looking - glass moments when bush is trying to make something that at the very least has to be seen as troubling , and that i consider an unmitigated failure , into a success . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

he was not given very much to work with -- cheney and rummy are the ones to blame for the screwed up war plans - of course i am sure they will get their medals too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush is one of those guys that just sees how he wants to see , and that is a terrible trait for a leader to have --- rose - colored something something i beleive it 's called . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

ok , so if iran is saying that they are moving forward with their nuclear programs for science and friendly nuclear energy , why is the us so worried ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are just trying to produce energy , as we have several nuclear power plants . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

why do they need a nuclear power plant ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
you have no problems with syria ? |||O O O O O O O 
so you believe him when he says that iran is n't looking for it , but you do n't believe the us when we say that we are n't ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is a cop - out response . |||O O O O O O O O 
the reason we are so worried is because we are on a higher level than 90 % of the world because we have nucler weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if countries we do n't like start developing nuclear weapons - grade material it makes us nervous . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although so far , iran has shown that they are * not * producing weapons - grade material and are in fact using their nuclear power for just that , according to the iaea . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but when you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other countries into a war , you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against iran . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
maybe because oil is a much bigger polluting source of energy than nuclear ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
or maybe because it 's more cost effective for them to use nuclear than any other method ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
why should they run their energy supply off of one of their backbone industries when oil is worth more to them on the open market ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we are definitely trying to do too many things at once , but syria has been fucking with the lebanese since before we came along . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

it 's not a question of whether i believe iran is telling the truth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the question was asked : why is the us scared of iran , and your response was " because they 're lying " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a cop - out because you 're not really proving anything , you 're just making accusations without proof . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ok , they made a very very small amount of a material that could maybe be used in a weapon if they had more of it possibly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the fact is that iran is cooperating with most of the international community on this issue , whether your believe them or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this was about nuclear proliferation , not iraq 's insurgency . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that if they have proof of iran 's assistance to iraqi insurgents that it can be dealt with later , once iraq is secure and able to handle its own affairs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for now , we were talking about the iranian nuclear program , not iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

syria has occupied lebanon , they are in violation of security council resolution 1559 stating that there should be no foreign forces in lebanon and that lebabon should be allowed to have free elections . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our alliance to them is supporting people that want to have a free democratically elected go v't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
finish the statement : then we will refer them to the security council . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what exactly is wrong with that ? |||O O O O O O O 
that is the type of diplomatic solution that all of the anti-war people wanted for iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course a whole bunch of resolutions did nothing in iraq , but who knows , maybe this time they will work . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
personally , based on the aggressive stance they have taken and the way they are helping the insurgency in iraq , i tend to not believe them when they say that they are n't looking for a confrontation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there is one carousel organization again |||O O O O O O 
rapid t. rabbit 17 feb 2005 17:19:51 - 0800 |||O O O O O O O O O 
there is one carousel organization again |||O O O O O O 
i just received the latest issue of merry - go- roundup , the quarterly publication of the national carousel association . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in it was a blurb reporting that the american carousel society had recently disbanded . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizations in the first place . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the national carousel association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors , including frederick fried , author of the 1964 book " a pictorial history of the carousel " that single - handedly gave the classic hand - carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
other founders included charlotte dinger , who was already a major collector of carousel artwork at the time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the purpose of the nca is " to promote conservation , appreciation , knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete wooden carousels . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the organization attracted a wide range of members , including carousel enthusiasts , owners / operators , theme and amusement parks , museums , libraries , those in the entertainment / recreation industry , art collectors and even auction houses , among others . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was the presence of these last two named groups that would eventually stir up controversy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thanks in large part to the nca , the art of the carousel was receiving a lot of public attention and appreciation that it had not enjoyed before . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , this new and brighter spotlight on these antique rides also had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collectibility and monetary value of operational carousels . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they had become worth more money dead ( i.e. in pieces ) than alive ( i.e. functioning ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as such , during the 1980's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be broken up at the auction block , as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation , as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses , while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable ( thrill ) rides . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their nca affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit , a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the increasing rift between the " preservationists " and " collectors " would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the nca to walk out of the group , including founders such as charlotte dinger and others . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the preservationists would chose to remain with the nca , including fred fried . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at this time in the late 1970 's , carousel artwork collector and printer marge swenson was the editor of the nca 's merry - go- roundup publication . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the political struggle that occurred within the nca resulted in two slates of officers being presented for approval to the membership , something that was not supposed to happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a thicker - than- usual issue of the roundup would be filled with accusations from both factions in the group each accusing the other of improper behavior . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
swenson herself would also leave the nca . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O 
not much later , she began publishing her own magazine called " carousel art " , which was essentially a scholarly photo album depicting different carvers and styles each month . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
meanwhile , those collectors who left the national carousel association banded together to form the american carousel society ( acs ) , whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for the next couple of decades , the two carousel organizations would co-exist , each attracting its share of members . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some would actually join both groups , and even attend both of their annual conventions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
during the mid-1980 's walter louck would begin publishing " the carousel trader " , later renamed " the carousel news & trader " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this monthly magazine would cover all angles and sides of the story of the carousel and be well received by all carousel enthusiasts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
about a decade later , carousel art would suddenly cease publication . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the nca would continue to issue the roundup to its members . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the mid to late 1990 's saw the passing of nca founder fred fried , and also that of charlotte dinger , both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coincidentally and amazingly , the art of building hand - carved carousels ( and even bandorgans ) has been revived , with firms such as carousel works and carousel magic again building the popular rides in classic design . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this development seems to have greatly alleviated the antique marketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carousels over the past several decades . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the turn of the new millenium actually witnessesed a thaw in the relationship between the national carousel association and american carousel society , as newer and younger leadership took over from the founding generation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the two groups decided that the bickering between them was wasteful , conterproductive and pointless . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there was talk of a ( re ) merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , it was decided that nca and acs hold joint conventions to save on costs to both the clubs and the members . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just within the past couple of months though , the american carousel society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so now , once again there is a single nationwide organization to join if you love carousels ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
club sports policies at schools ; specifically travel restrictions |||O O O O O O O O O

club sports policies at schools ; specifically travel restrictions |||O O O O O O O O O 
i am attempting to learn more information about the policies of various athletic departments at schools , specifically with regards to ultimate teams . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at northwestern , the men's ultimate team falls under the club sports department which falls into a dark , barely lit corner of the athletic department . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are some restrictions on what we can and can not do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the one that i am most interested in comparing to similar policies at other schools concerns our ability to travel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at northwestern , we are allowed to either rent school vans for no charge or take our own vehicles to tournaments within 300 miles of evanston , il . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also , we are allowed to fly , take a bus , or take amtrak to any tournament we want , no matter how far away it is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we are allowed to compete under the northwestern name if we take any of these options . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , it often occurs that we want to go to a tournament farther than 300 miles without flying . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( for example , regionals is often slightly farther than 300 miles , yet a reasonable drive . ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if we choose to do so , it is understood that we are not officially competing under the northwestern name - we are just a group of people playing ultimate at a tournament and not involving the university in any way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do any of you other college players face similar restrictions in your travel ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what are your schools ' policies ? |||O O O O O O O 
i am interested in both the responses of players at public and private schools . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : club sports policies at schools ; specifically travel restrictions |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
man ... you guys have it so sweet . |||O O O O O O O O O 
pitt get s $ 2000 / year towards competition . |||O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
that means bids , hotel , transportation , jerseys ( i do have to mention , our jerseys this year are hot ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that does nt go very far , and that s a hard cap on anything related to competition for all competetive club sports teams . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
next year we will be budgeting our jerseys as " practice jerseys " however , so we hope they 'll be paid for . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the point is , $ 2 k gets us to about a tournament and a half using university transportation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do nt know about playing officially under the university 's name , or why that matters really . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as long as the registrar signs off on the roster for the upa , does nt the importance of university affiliation become moot ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i should clarify that nu does not specifically pay for us to fly - we get a budget as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we pay for our flights / rental cars out of pocket . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : club sports policies at schools ; specifically travel restrictions |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
at suny albany in ny , about as state school as you can get , we get about 500 less than what you 're talking about at pitt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our school does n't really care what we do at tournaments or how far away we are . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we take our own cars to every tournament , even ones down in maryland . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the money we get from our student association has to pay for jerseys , is supposed to help us with tournaments , etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
every tournament our team goes to , we each pay 10 - 20 bucks out of pocket . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you are an ultimate frisbee team and sleeping in hotels ... consider yourself as spoiled as an ultimate team gets in my opinion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you got ta learn how to save money . |||O O O O O O O O O 
most tournaments will house you if you ask and explain your situation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if we ca n't get housing , we camp out somewhere . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at binghamton this year we threw up a tent on the high jump mat ( which i must say is very comfortable ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
regionals 2 years ago , our team and about 7 others could n't afford housing at princeton so we camped way way out back on the fields and hung out all night . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for you northwestern guys , you really need to get in touch with someone at your school that will listen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our school did n't like us for a long time , but we behaved ourselves , and very respectfully approached various people , working our way up the ladder , about changing some policies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
start off low , and work your way up . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
explain to them that if you are driving your own cars , you should be able to go wherever you want , and even throw in there if for any reason you bring shame to the university , you will go right back to the old policy no questions asked . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how often do you go to a tournament and whatever happens there gets back to administration ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
pretty much never so your safe with that offer . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
another thing we did was have a lot of fundraisers on campus , entered banner contests for sporting events , etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
once the school saw that unlike a lot of clubs , we were busting our asses to fundraise and get involved with school activities , their whole attitude towards us changed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sell discs , sell pint glasses , then go to someone , more than one person , and show them what kind of effort you are putting in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a lot of school officials do n't understand how structured ultimate actually is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
go in and explain to them about regionals not just being some little " get together " but actually be a championship series . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : renewal of marriage vows on carnival cruise |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
my wife and i were guests at a wedding on the carnival legend on new years eve 2003 . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
all the guests were folks who had met the bride and groom ( an attractive young couple who were sailing alone ) virtually on cruisecritic . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the wedding took place in the afternoon , before the ship set sail . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thus , the couple was actual married by a justice of the peace in the state of florida . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a great way to begin a cruise . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
although i am not certain of this , i assume that renewing your vows could actually be done while the ship was at sea , because it would not involve any legal issues . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

- has anybody out there seen this done ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know the details , but on my last cruise there was a large wedding going on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
the bride was all decked out in her long gown and veil , groom in tux and the other wedding party all dressed to the nines ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
they had one of the larger lounges closed off for a private reception . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did n't think it was allowed any more , but 30 minutes until sailing an announcement was made that all non cruise guests must make their way to disembark the ship prior to sailing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i had never heard that announcement before so i assumed that it was for the people attending the wedding on board ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
this was the largest wedding gathering i have ever seen on board ... maybe someone had connections ??? |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O

on 16 feb 2005 13:36:29 - 0800 , |||O O O O O O O O 
we renewed our vows on carnival conquest on 10/31/2004 - you need to contact carnival wedding department and ask if they have any wedding / renewal packages available . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these usally take a little time to set up - if you are going in march i am not sure if / what would be available to you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they were just starting a new renewal of vows program , which included all we rec'd , but was cheaper . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
since we had already paid for our package we kept it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
had a very nice ceremony with a justice of the peace and a small reception for the family members traveling with us . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

carnival corp - shareholder discount on princess |||O O O O O O O 
i 'm taking a 7 day cruise with princess in march and applied for my $ 100 carnival corp . shareholder onboard credit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
turns out that my travel agent has a ' group ' cruise on this ship and my $ 50 / pp credit due to the ' group ' cruise makes me ineligible for the shareholder credit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this really makes a mockery of the shareholder credit as almost every cruise has some sort of small credit attached . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
$ 100 wo n't break the bank or make the cruise less enjoyable , nor will i stop being a shareholder , but i do find this sort of thing irritating . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can get the larger of the shipboard credits . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
until recently you could combine the stockholder credits with the credits for booking on board , but not with those from your agent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the most recent carnival report under shareholder benefit says , " not combinable with any other shipboard offer " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i believe that clause actually refers to promo cruises etc. and not to discounts , or shipboard credits offered by your ta . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we * just * got back into washington last evening , after our brief 5 - day trip to london . |||O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
thanks for all of the responses to my earlier inquiries , i 'm happy to report that everything went pretty well , but both my wife and i are pretty beat / tired . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we got into heathrow on monday morning . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O 
at the airport , i got some cash from the barclays atm just outside the arrival area , as many have suggested . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
fyi , i just checked my bank account , and we got charged a $ 2.00 fee and the exchange rate was around $ 1.92 / gpb . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after that , we took the underground into london . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
zone 1 - 6 all - day pass cost 5.40 gbp each . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that was pretty easy ... the most difficult part was finding the hotel once we finally got off at the final tube station . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the hotel was nice enough to let us check in , even though we were a bit early ( we got in around 12:30 , normal check - in time was 14:30 ) , which we were really grateful for , after dragging our bags for a couple of hours . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after settling into the hotel room ( my wife is an " unpack everything - and - stow it " type of person ) , we went to do a little exploring . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
being that this was a holiday , a lot of the local places were closed ( including restaurants in the hotel ) , but we found a kind of combo newsagent / foodstore nearby , and we picked up a 5 gbp calling card ( for calling home ) and some drinks ( 1.59 gpb for ~2 liter pepsi light , .98 gbp for a ~2 liter water ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it took us awhile , but we found a restaurant / pub ( white swan ) that was open . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it seemed like a kind of local place , and the woman that was running the place was very nice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when we walked in , we stood around waiting to be seated :) , and she said " this is a pub , sit anywhere , and order at the bar " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i gathered ( from that and a few visits at other pubs ) that that 's the norm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyway , we had a nice late lunch : fish and chips ( with " mashed peas " ) for me , and a beef pie for my wife . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
fyi , this was probably the most reasonable meal that we had during our whole visit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that night , we walked around the area around the victoria underground station , because we were suppose to meet up with a tour the next morning . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while there , we found a local sainsbury ( kind of a small supermarket ) about 2 blocks from the underground station , and stocked up on some cheese , milk , and croissants . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
prices here were a bit cheaper than the local foodstore , and during our trip , i made several trips here :) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
we were n't sure what we wanted to eat for dinner , so we just wandered around a bit , and finally ended up at a " steakhouse " near the station ... big mistake . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the food , service , and prices were very bad ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i guess we should have figured that one out when 3 other parties walked out after being seated , but unfortunately , we had already ordered , so we felt kind of obligated to finish . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know if this is the case with all " steakhouses " , but we stayed away from them all after that :( . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we took an all day bus tour ( evan evans ) , including the london eye . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
took the underground to victoria , and walked to the victoria coach station ( it 's not the same :) ) . |||B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i thought that the tour was a pretty good way to get introduced to part of the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we got to see a lot in a short time , including extended tours of westminster ( felt kind of strange walking over dead people ) and the tower of london ( neat ! ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this tour included lunch at another pub near trafalgar square ( more beef pies for us ) , and the tour guide was very good , and kind of funny . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was kind of like travelling with a " grand dad " and he did his best to keep us all together . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the end of the land tour , we went on ride on one of the thames cruise boats ( warning , it is freezing on the top deck ... ) , and then a ride on the london eye . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all in all , recommended , but afterwards , both my wife and i agreed that an " all - day " tour was too exhausting ( even on a bus tour , you have to do a lot of walking especially getting to the changing of the guards and at the london tower ) , and we probably would 've preferred breaking it into 2 1 / 2 day tours . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we also took one of the hop - on / hop - off bus tours ( the " original " ) on one of the other day , as we thought it was the easiest way to get around to the places that we wanted to re-visit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
take the one with the live guide if you can , as it 's much more interesting than the ones with the recorded commentary ( you can ask questions ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also , if you want to get a seat on the top deck , take one of the earlier buses , as at least when we were there , it was impossible to get a seat on top later in the day , and you ca n't see much from the lower ( enclosed ) deck ( but it 's much warmer :) ! ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we had been buying the 2 - zone all - day tube passes ( 4.20 gbp each ) everyday , just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own , but by the time this was all over , my wife did n't feel like taking the underground back to heathrow , so we had asked the hotel conceierge to make a reservation on an airport bus ( 15 gbp each ) , but he instead offered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35 gbp , which is what we did . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this was perfect , because it got us door - to - door from the hotel to lhr terminal 3 with no hassles at all . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would n't have done that from lhr to the hotel , but since the concierge was arranging it , i felt that it 'd be safe , and the driver turned out to be pretty nice . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
overall , it was an enjoyable , but really exhausting trip ( we live in the suburbs , so i guess we 're not use to walking everywhere ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
luckily this was n't a " shopping " trip , because things are ( at least from americans ) really expensive . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that if i was dealing in gpbs all the time , it would n't seem so bad , but i remember sitting at the ice cream ( " gelato " ? ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
counter at harrods , and watching two little kids , each eating some sundaes that cost 15 gpb each ( $ 30.00 ) , and thinking " wow ! " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

angus steakhouse by any chance ? |||O O O O O O 
i have never heard anything but bad stuff about them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are not british in the food sense , that 's for sure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
pub food is usually a good bet in the uk . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the cities invariably involve a lot of walking , and this is seen as a pleasure , not a task . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's very expensive , even by london standards . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
harrods is harrods though , and most people go there to be blown away by the prices . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course everyone feels compelled to buy ' something ' . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i opted for a few chocolates , which were very good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
good report of a good trip , even if you did fall for a couple of the tourist traps ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

comments on suggested travel plans through new england |||O O O B-TRI O O O O 
i live in austin , tx , and being one who 's only been as far as nashville , tn two friends and i are planning a trip to new england for a week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
i 'd love some insight or suggestions on our trip itinerary -- |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
first i went to expedia and did some flight checks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're planning on going july 4th week -- what better time to be in boston i figure :) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
saturday , july 2nd - fly from austin , tx to boston and stay with friends living in boston |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sunday , july 3rd - hang around boston and stay with friends |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
monday , july 4th - hang around boston and stay with friends |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tuesday , july 5th - leave early and drive to niagara falls , ny - 467 miles - stay in niagara falls |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wednesday , july 6th - leave from niagara falls and drive to toronto , on - 85 miles - drive back to niagara falls that evening - 85 miles - stay in niagara falls |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thursday , july 7th - leave niagara falls and drive to red bank , ny - 435 miles - stay in red bank for the night - we want to hit - up jay and silent bob 's silent stash |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
friday , july 8th - drive back to boston passing through new york -- do whatever -- 262 miles from red banks to boston but add whatever miles from new york - stay the night with friends in boston |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
saturday , july 9th - fly back to austin |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i figure staying in red bank , nj , which is n't far from nyc , is cheaper then staying in the city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
plus while driving back north to boston we can spend the day in nyc . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know there 's way too much to do , but i have another friend who works at the met i 'll try to hook - up with . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll plan our few hours in nyc wisely . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
also we 're hanging in boston for so many nights to visit with the friends there and hit the sights in that area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also this is a vacation , so we hope to spend some time just chilling . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have 3 people going , and expedia shows the flight ( round trip ) and a rental car with unlimited miles being $ 1430 , plus i 'm figuring about $ 150 for gas and at $ 120 a night for hotel that 's $ 360 total for that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so total cost ( without food , spending cash , parking , toll roads , etc ) is $ 1910 or about $ 637 each . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm figuring about $ 850 per person should be plenty for everything -- and that 's not bad for 7 nights in new enland with all the stuff we 're planning . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i miss anything or does anyone see any suggestions or changes that might either save money or make our trip more worthwild ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thanks again , and take care , |||O O O O O O O 
oh -- what kinda weather can we expect up there during july ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
texas is in the 100's normally , so i hope the averages for july in new england are a fare bit cooler :) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : comments on suggested travel plans through new england |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
unless there 's something in particular you want to see in toronto , i do n't see any reason to make this long side trip . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would suggest heading back to red bank or wherever and trying to carve out an extra day in new york city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can find hotels in your price range , especially with three sharing a room . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you might want to drop off the car somewhere near red bank , or as soon as you arrive in new york , if the drop off charges are n't too much . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then you could spend part of one day in new york ( and a good part of the next day , assuming you dropped toronto ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then you could take the train or bus back to boston . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it might work out cheaper in the long run , especially when you consider the cost of parking in new york . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : comments on suggested travel plans through new england |||O O O O O O O O O O 
thanks for all the great replies !! |||O O O O O O O 
this is exactly what i 'm looking for :) |||O O O O O O O O O 
the main reason i 'd like to goto toronto and niagara falls is mainly because it 's so close .. but i agree new york would be nice to spend a few days in . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know the bulk of our trip is in boston , but we have friends living up there we hope to spend a few days with visiting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the trip is both to visit with them and to spend time around new england . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as for gas , what is the going rate for gas right now in new england ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here in texas it 's around $ 1.60 - $ 1.75 for reg unleadded , but i 'm figuring $ 1.90 a gallon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here 's how i figured the price i 'm factoring in -- boston to niagara falls - 467 miles niagara falls to toronto - 85 miles and 85 miles back niagara falls to red bank , nj - 435 miles red bank , nj to boston ( plus spending some time in nyc ) - 262 |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
total is 1334 , but i 'm figuring 1500 with some extra for around nyc and various towns we visit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 're getting a mid-sized vehicle , so if the car gets 20 mpg that 's 75 gallons used . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this times $ 1.90 is $ 145.50 or around that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
even if gas is $ 2.00 a gallon that 's still only around $ 150 , so i think $ 200 + for gas is a rather high estimate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also is it possible to take a train from boston to nyc ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if so how does that work or what 's the cost ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i am from texas where we drive everywhere , and i 've never even set foot on a train -- so forgive me if this is a weird question :) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thanks again for all the insight and help . |||O O O O O O O O O 
though i 've never been up there i 've always wanted to see both niagara falls and toronto , so being so close i almost hate to miss an opportunity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : did you miss the inaugural address ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
the administration 's approach to history is at odds with what has been described by a communications adviser to the president as the " reality - based community . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a dumb phrase , but not a dumb thought : |||O O O O O O O O O O 
he meant that the administration sees history as dynamic and changeable , not static and impervious to redirection or improvement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is the bush administration way , and it happens to be realistic : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
history is dynamic and changeable . |||O O O O O O 
on the other hand , some things are constant , such as human imperfection , injustice , misery and bad government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this world is not heaven . |||O O O O O O 
the president 's speech seemed rather heavenish . |||O O O O O O O O 
it was a god - drenched speech . |||O O O O O O O O 
this president , who has been accused of giving too much attention to religious imagery and religious thought , has not let the criticism enter him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" " god moves and chooses as he wills . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
we have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind . . . the longing of the soul . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ending tyranny in the world ? |||O O O O O O 
well that 's an ambition , and if you 're going to have an ambition it might as well be a big one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but this declaration , which is not wrong by any means , seemed to me to land somewhere between dreamy and disturbing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tyranny is a very bad thing and quite wicked , but one does n't expect we 're going to eradicate it any time soon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
again , this is not heaven , it 's earth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is -- how else to put it ?-- over the top . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is the kind of sentence that makes you wonder if this white house did not , in the preparation period , have a case of what i have called in the past " mission inebriation . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a sense that there are few legitimate boundaries to the desires born in the goodness of their good hearts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one wonders if they should n't ease up , calm down , breathe deep , get more securely grounded . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the most moving speeches summon us to the cause of what is actually possible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
perfection in the life of man on earth is not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O

read lincoln 's rather short 2nd inaugural |||O O O O O O O 
it 's about as " god drenched ' as you could get . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
way more so than bush 's ( god , he , the lord , etc. ) over and over and over again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
considering the brevity of the speech , you could barely fit any more " god 's " and such in the address without buying vowels and consonants from vanna at a 5 fer 1 speshul price . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : did you miss the inaugural address ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
to put it simply ( for your benefit ) : |||O O O O O O O O O O 
lincoln spoke *of * god , demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more similarities ( their religious beliefs among them ) than differences . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dubya spoke * for * god , demanding that we should all fall in line behind him , because he 's got the plan , and god 's on his side . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my favorite part of the speech , though , is this line : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you have to admire the sheer audacity of doublespeak like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
especially when the list of the ' willing ' just went into the circular file a few days ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush 's inaugural is an announcement that the bush doctrine was as much a sales pitch as the wmd justification ; bushco has n't abandoned the neocon ideal of a pax americana . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i guess it 's a matter of personal taste . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
some people like barry manilow . |||O O O O O O 
it seems to me bush is getting a bit pie - eyed and mystical . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's carrying out god 's destiny to liberate mankind , and trusting in god to deliver a favorable outcome for a just cause . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is a fine sounding theory , but the results of bush 's policies look worse every day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sunnis say iraq poll illegitimate . |||O O O O O O 
are there minimal requirements before an election can be considered an legitimate election ? |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O 
the recent iraq election was boycott by the sunnis which constitute about 20 % of the population . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for example , in a city of 200,000 only 1400 had casted their votes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
many of the 1400 were civil workers and polices are shiites from the south . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in fallujah , there were 5 voting stations with only one vote casted . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if so , should that affect the legitimacy of the election ? |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
sunnis say iraq poll illegitimate |||O O O O O 
a leading group of iraqi sunni clerics have said the country 's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many sunnis did not take part in the vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the clerics had encouraged sunnis to boycott the elections because of the presence of us and foreign troops . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
the us and iraqi authorities , as well as the united nations , have hailed the election as a " victory for democracy " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O

re : when is an election not an election ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
fundamentally , choosing not to vote is actually a vote for the other side . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you choose not to vote , then you choose to give your opponents all the power . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the sunni 's were prevented , or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote , then they could claim illegitimacy , but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote , then they declared the vote legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to all non-sunnis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you are talking about physically restricted to vote at election day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , it is not the sunni clerics ' complaints . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
rather , their state reason is related to the reality that iraq is currently under occupation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
does the presence of foreign troops makes them less free ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
were they consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats from the votes gain ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in addition , they are restricted from moving freely in their own country and / or their own city , would that not restricted their election related activities ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : when is an election not an election ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
their stated reason for not voting was because the country was under occupation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they faced , however , no pressure from the rest of the country , nor from the " occupying " forces to stay away from the vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the sunni 's now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they did n't vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's not their right to decide the legitimacy of the vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the sunni 's had all the power about a year ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then they , the minority , were toppled , and they used their power to intimidate and threaten shi'ites through the entire period . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
who do you think the insurgents were killing -- shi'ites . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
if anyone has a right to call the elections " illegitimate " it would be the shi'ites . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they were invited to participate in each such decision . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
they are not restricted from moving within their own country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the shi'ites had no problems turning out in large groups . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the situation is hardly novel . |||O O O O O O

the hmong will not be sitting and watching from the sideline . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
america has positioned its pieces on the chess board of global domination very carefully . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
1 . the us will use hmong american sentiments against lpdr as the starting point for a regime change in laos . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , laos is not the goal ; checkmate is the fall of china , and economic control of china . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the us will support one or two hmong individuals to speak out against lpdr human rights violation and chao fa resistance fighters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with a precedant set in iraq for preemptive attacks , laos will be taken overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for u.s. military attacks on china . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
2 . the us 's policy of handing out ntr will have the desired effect of reeling in alliances from the surrounding countries of china . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we shall wait and see if chinese fat or american fat taste better to lpdr . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if lpdr plays ball with uncle sam , then there will be no bloodshed in laos . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
when the americans get into laos , the artificial cooperation will be sufficient for some strategic political changes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some hmong americans may be reintroduced to laos . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
some hmong in laos , namely , chao fa , will be a good source of intelligence on lao - china border activities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
fa 's chance to replace their diet of tree roots with rice and fish . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
again , america has lpdr under its control , and america can launch airstrikes and ground units from laos . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
3 . regardless of what happens , the u.s. has a direct ethnic connection to china by way of hmong , which will secure cia - insurgency operations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
unlike the current situation in the middle - east , where the number of arabic - speaking cia agents are few , there will be plenty of hmong / chinese - speaking cia agents for disposal and use in the looming sino - us war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
perhaps by route of thailand , if lpdr does not cooperate , the us will incite insurrection in the southern provinces of china . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
these provinces have a lot of hmong people , and have been known to be the fiercest opposition to chinese rule ( aka remember the miao rebellions ? ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
this will be the hmong 's god - given chance to fight for their own country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
let 's see if they ( and we ) agree to a coaltion government like the kurds in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those are just 3 options . |||O O O O O O 
they all involve hmong people . |||O O O O O O 
read between the lines , the war will not be between the us and north korea . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
china is using north korea to escalate sino - us relations and test uncle sam 's temper . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i sure hope i am not sitting and watching when this all goes down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is the perfect opportunity . |||O O O O O O 
as hmong people say , " water runs strongly , engine sounds good . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

patrick powers 4 nov 2004 20:48:36 -0800 enron & india |||O O O O O O O O O O 
in india , bechtel along with general electric are the new owners of the notorious and currently defunct enron power project . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the enron contract , which legally binds the government of the state of maharashtra to pay enron a sum of 30 billion dollars , was the largest contract ever signed in india . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
enron was not shy to boast about the millions of dollars it had spent to " educate " indian politicians and bureaucrats . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the enron contract in maharashtra , which was india 's first ' fast - track ' private power project , has come to be known as the most massive fraud in the country 's history . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( enron was another of the republican party 's major campaign contributors ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the electricity that enron produced was so exorbitant that the government decided it was cheaper not to buy electricity and pay enron the mandatory fixed charges specified in the contract . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this means that the government of one of the poorest countries in the world was paying enron 220 million us dollars a year not to produce electricity ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now that enron has ceased to exist , bechtel and ge are suing the indian government for 5.6 billion us dollars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is not even a minute fraction of the sum of money that they ( or enron ) actually invested in the project . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
once more , it 's a projection of profit they would have made had the project materialized . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
zztop8970 fri , 05 nov 2004 15:36:53 gmt |||O O O O O O O O 
for a slightly different perspective : |||O O O O O O 
" maharashtra officials say the cost of power supplied by enron is nearly double the tariff charged by indian power producers , and used it as an excuse to stop paying state debts to the plant . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" enron had signed a power purchase agreement with power utility mseb eight years ago , under which a $ 3 bn 2,182 megawatt power plant was to be commissioned . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the project ran into trouble nearly two years ago with the indian authorities beginning to delay payments saying enron 's power tariff was too high ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
though enron officials refuse to talk about the price they would be willing to sell their stake at , analysts say the us company is demanding about one billion dollars for its investments in india . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so far it has only got offers of about half that amount from indian companies and financial institutions , but enron is unwilling to sell it s stake at a price lower than the cost . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in case no satisfactory offer comes from the indian side , enron will have little option but to go for international arbitration as their investments in the country were guaranteed by the indian government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but arbitration proceedings can be a long and messy affair . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
analysts say both india and enron have little to gain from a protracted legal battle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the best way out could be a compromise by which enron gets less than what it is demanding and more than what the indians are presently offering . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iow : no fraud , just a basic business dispute , in which the party reneging on its obligations is the go v't of maharashtra . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the maharashtra officials are either incompetent fools , or worse - malicious fraudsters who conned an international comapny into building a state - of - the - art power plant for them at a cost of billions of dollars , and then refused payment , knowing the company has no legal recourse except lengthy international arbitration , and will likely sell the plant to them for a fraction of its true value . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

iraq elections at this point |||O O O O O 
rhooker...@hotmail.com 11 feb 2005 01:45:13 - 0800 iraq elections at this point |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i actually ca n't recall it ever taking 2 weeks to " count " these many ballots , generally elections are called within 24 hours . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
in this case counting is taking 2 weeks . |||O O O O O O O O O 
what is strange is everyone knows who won , sistani won . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O 
his party , the major winner , could not field canidates until just before the election , but it was his face on all the poster and his part wipped up the heavily funded us supported government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so we have the voice of the people of iraq , even if the sunni 's had voted sistani would still be the majority leader . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but he was not running . |||O O O O O O 
so the us has entered in to the classic |||O O O O O O O O O 
shia quicksand of islamic republics , which have caused it such problems in iran . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sistani will run iraq , or the election will be ignored . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the problem with sistani running iraq is he refuses to talk to the ameircans , and as the real power broker what ever figure heads take the pm and other posts will speak with as little authority as their counter parts in iran . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the us is now fighting a war for a nation who government they have no direct ties with . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the other option , and what the us seems to be trying , is to somehow fudge the election so sistani does not win , that raise doubts about the outcome , claiming fraud , do anything so that the election causes to results . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
given the american attention span is about 10 minuts the creation of a dictatorship of us puppets against the election would be ignored in the us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
this would actually be not only in the us best interest , but might be militarily necessary . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i ca n't imagine how the us occupation could operate in a situation where sistani has the ultimate power . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the long run i ca n't see how iraq can avoid civil war , since its had it so many times in the past . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
civil war leading to the victory of one group is the norm in iraq , and was the casue of most mass graves in the 1980s and 1990s . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
likely only sanctions have killed more . |||O O O O B-TRI O O 
sistani has the popular support and the claim of the election which the ameircans bungled baddly and allowed him to take over . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
the sunni 's have the weapons , the skill , and the support . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the us occupation is becoming more difficult by the day and bush has shown he fails to understand the situation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hell when the worst possible event in the election was happening , sistani was flooding the polls with his supporters bush was crowing . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sadly bush 's concerns are short - term politics in the south of ameirca , and they have already decided they do n't have to pay attention to iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with more and mmore sunni supporting the insurgents iran , the big winner in all of this , will feel the need to back sistani in the south . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so if the us leaves it s possible we could see iraq carved up between the groups . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : iraq elections at this point |||O O O B-TRI O O O 
it is pretty bizarre , considering how long they had to organize elections . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
it may be that they want the public to get adjusted to the fact that the shia 's are taking over before announcing official results . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the us is not going to change the results . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
a shia government will allow us an exit strategy . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
all we have won in iraq is maybe a shaky neutrality . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it s not like germany or japan where they were so terrified of the soviets post war that they were happy to see the us stick around . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O

do n't even bother asking if this guy remembers the iraq / iran war of 1980- 1988 , which when saddam launched a land / air invasion of iran . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

how about saddam 's use of chemical weapons ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
recall that we ( and the brits ) involved ourselves in that war only in 1987 , after attacks on kuwaiti oil tankers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how many iraqis and iranians were killed in that war ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O

i 've read quite a few more rational works describing how the us was doing its best to avoid , or at the very least postpone , a war against japan , mainly because fdr was trying to provoke hitler to war and did n't need a distraction on another distant front . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists , mainly the ones who expounded that fdr knew pearl harbor was about to be attacked , and let it happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of their " proofs " was that the us carriers were out of port during the attack , and " everybody knew " carriers were the capital ship of the future . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , the two carriers operating out of pearl at the moment were sent west with light escort , on possibly intersecting routes with the ijn kido butai , which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even stranger , the uss enterprise was scheduled to be at pearl by dec 6th , but got delayed by a storm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
consequently , for the ph conspiracy theorists to believe that fdr kept the carriers out of harm 's way , we not only have to grant fdr the full knowledge of kido butai 's route of approach would not result in either usn carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle , but that fdr could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent halsey from sailing into pearl and thus be ambushed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to make a very long story short , it is foolish to assume that the us wanted to go to war against japan prior to 1941 , considering the weight of evidence arguing against a us desire for war , and the overwhelming lack of evidence ( not to mention rational thought ) arguing for a us desire for war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

here 's something i wrote as part of a larger article , some while ago : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
was n't japan just defending herself when she attacked the us ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that japan was being " driven into a corner " by sanctions , and had no choice but to attack the us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
meiji japan was driven to emulate what it thought the |||O O O O O O O O O O 
west was doing in every facet of society . |||O O O O O O O O O 
they had observed , for example , that the west was able to carve up china into " spheres of influence " , and was able to do from great distances , while they , the japanese , had had limited success in their previous attempts to dominate the korean peninsula , much less china . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as part of the catch - up effort , she whole - heartedly entered into the imperialist game in asia , being treated as an equal ( relative to her power ) by the other powers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , after world war i , japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former imperial partners ; they began a long , slow process of disengaging themselves from their former imperial areas , from their colonies , in addition to outright stopping all expansions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
japan chose to read this as a sign that the west had lost its power and resolve , and that japan was the rightful heir to imperial mantle in asia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led japan 's rise to international prominence , and the refusal of the us to intervene in asian affairs , in addition to the bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from germany , britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive japan in the area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
having a keen grasp of the obvious , she began a policy of acceding to japanese hegemony in the area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
japan continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand , illusive scheme of a " greater asia " , subordinate and grateful to japan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the reality of this was that only a single possession , manchuria , was profitable to the japanese , and the rest of the empire turned out to be a drain . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this drain was greatly accelerated by japan 's invasion of china proper in 1936 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a war that japan assumed would be ended in " 3 to 6 months " ; at the time of pearl harbor , it had been going on for 5 years , at the cost of over half a million japanese lives . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the war put a tremendous strain on japan ( and was in fact opposed by more radically nationalistic elements , as taking away from the development of japan 's other possessions , particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel . ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
domestic consumption fell , consumer goods became scarce , and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into japan 's domestic industry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this cut further into her foreign reserves , exacerbating the economic impact of the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the war effort took on a life of its own , however , and common sense was subordinated to it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
japan expanded into areas of china and indochina which had no strategic value to her , but put her in a position to threaten british and dutch possessions in the area ; possessions that both those allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against hitler . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at this point , the us stopped ignoring the japanese threat , and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on japan , cutting off her scrap metal , limitting and then cutting off her oil ( japan imported most of both from the us . ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for japan to do well if the war in china stopped , they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
an abortive attack on soviet positions in mongolia had placed japan 's focus firmly south , towards the possessions of the us ' future allies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for no reason anyone could articulate , japan felt she had to continue the war in china . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to continue the war in china , she had to have resources of oil and metal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to have these resources , she must seize them , if others refused to sell them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in order to seize them , she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thus , for a " 3 to 6 month " operation in china in 1937 , japan would embark on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she had acquired in 70 years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she must seize them , if others refused to sell them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

in 1860 there was a four -way race between the republican party with abraham lincold , the democratic party with stephen douglas , the southern democratic party with john breckenridge , and the constitutional union party with john bell . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

re : the 1860 presidential election |||O O O O O B-TRI 
" one feature of the result must not be omitted . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
many careless observers felt at the time that the success of lincoln was due entirely to the fact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field ; or , in other words , to the dissensions in the democratic party , which divided its vote between breckinridge and douglas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what merely moral strength the democratic party would have gained had it remained united , it is impossible to estimate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
such a supposition can only be based on the absence of the extreme southern doctrines concerning slavery . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
given the presence of those doctrines in the canvass , no hypothesis can furnish a result different from that which occurred . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the contest upon the questions as they existed , the victory of lincoln was certain . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if all the votes given to all the opposing candidates had been concentrated and cast for a ' fusion ticket , ' as was wholly or partly done in five states , the result would have been changed nowhere except in new jersey , california , and oregon ; lincoln would still have received but 11 fewer , or 169 electoral votes -- majority of 35 in the entire electoral college . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
abraham lincoln , a history , volume 2 by john george nicolay and john hay |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
see for a confirmation of the electoral arithmetic : |||O O O O O O O O O 
the states where lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote ( i.e. , all the free states except oregon , california , and new jersey ) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the electoral college . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the reason that lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer " wasted " votes than his opponents -- in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti-lincoln opposition might have done better than all the otl anti-lincoln candidates combined , because the mere fact of the divided nature of lincoln 's opposition might have discouraged anti-lincoln men and led to fewer of them voting than would otherwise be the case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but given that turnout was quite high in 1860 , i doubt this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one thing seems reasonably clear to me : if there was to be a united anti - lincoln opposition , douglas could not lead it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was hated too much in the south for his opposition to the admission of kansas as a state under the pro-slavery lecompton constitution and for his interpretation of dred scott as still allowing territories to exclude slavery through unfriendly local legislation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for douglas 's defense of his position . ) |||O O O O O O O O O 
he and breckinridge and bell would have to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate -- former governor horatio seymour of new york was one proposal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but i doubt that seymour would have been able to do better than all the combined otl anti-lincoln candidates in such close states as illinois and indiana |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and his own state of new york was not really close enough for me to believe he could have taken that state from the lincoln column . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i was watching the bbc news this morning and they interviewed the man who is going to be in charge of holocaust day , certainly in the future . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he very specifically mentioned gays , along with blacks and roma , and said that he was going to try and link future days to the dangers of current prejudice and oppression . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is a bit like rating stalin and hitler for badness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's " significant " if any group of people is identified for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live , surely ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if there are n't as many identifiable individuals from a particular group in the general population , then by your significance = headcount yardstick some groups are never ever going to get rated as " significant " . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in some ways , it is amazing that the nazis were able to identify even * two * thousand homosexuals in the thirties . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
by a bitter irony , without the burgeoning gay liberation movement in germany ( magnus hirschfeld et al ) the issue may not even have arisen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

peter ould fri , 28 jan 2005 12:14:56 gmt |||O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm simply trying to get some perspective . |||O O O O O O O O O 
the holocaust of the jews and zigeuner was motivated by racial prejudices . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the murder of ( at the most ) 10 k homosexuals was n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most homosexuals arrested during the nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you were homosexually oriented but did nothing with it the law in 30s germany could n't touch you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the jews and zigeuner on the other hand were killed simply for their ontological state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
once again , i 'm not diminishing the horror of any individual murder , just trying to get it into perspective . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

hang on a moment up there you say |||O O O O O O O O 
it 's shrunk , i think your agenda is showing ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and that previous quote says |||O O O O O 
i think the chance of their being only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of homosexuality during the nazi rule , finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence , but 10 - 15 k seems reasonable |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
scott 2004-11-01t11:44:00 again i apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on friday a small group of friends and i attended a most - righteous sister hazel concert at floyd 's music store for the third straight , and for the third straight year i was blown away by one of my favorite live bands . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sister hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by brining them into the show . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's something you can always expect from these guys , unlike so many other performers , and is why i never miss a show when they 're in town . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on saturday we hosted what was for the most part a largely successful halloween party -- save for the fake blood stains on the carpet and bathroom walls , a couple beer spills , unnecessary fights and the expected trashing of the kitchen and living room areas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
naturally , i dressed up as hugh hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was having a good time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have yet to hear any complaints from any of the guests . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on saturday the seminoles were bested by unranked maryland ; effectively ending our chances at a national title this year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in addition , the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as chris rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alas , too little too late was the case thanks to the inept wyatt sexton who has been our starter since replacing rix earlier in the season . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
fortunately the agony of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our halloween party and i wo n't have to worry about seminole football until next saturday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on sunday we saw " saw " ( review coming ) and as expected i was less than satisfied . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was neither better nor worse than last week 's " the grudge " but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror movies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if i enjoy one out of five considering the genre i can say it 's worth it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i wish i could have been at a pub , or wherever these people convene , to see the reactions from all the britons who read the telegraph this morning ( emphasis added ) : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
britain 's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target , curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years , according to an international firearms legislation expert . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
prof gary mauser said that britain was making the same mistake as canada and australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law - abiding community where gun crimes , such as the dunblane massacre , were aberrations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the home office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands , said prof mauser , a member of the independent fraser institute in canada . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he has given evidence to select committees of the house of commons and the canadian senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on britain 's streets . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
his warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day in england and wales , more than twice the level of when the labour government came to power in 1997 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O 
in the past two years , there have been cases of schoolchildren and a baby , killed or injured by guns . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O 
" i believe that factors of political correctness are at work , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" police crackdowns , home office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
prof mauser added : " the sad truth is that while the police officers are inspecting farmers ' gun cabinets to see if they comply with regulations somewhere in the uk , someone , who has not filled in a firearms certificate form , will be smuggling a gun into the country or selling one to an inner city youth . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to june . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
two - thirds of gun crime takes place in london , birmingham and manchester . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it does n't matter to these people that crime has skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in great britain . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just as long as it 's there , they feel safe . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
more than a few e-mails have come in wondering why i have n't remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on nov. 21 that left six people dead , and why i have n't updated the assault weapons ban counter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i did n't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue , but i have been extremely busy last week with thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is problem that needs to be addressed . |||O O O O O O O O O 
but as for the assault weapons ban issue , the man accused of the brutal killings , chai vang of st. paul , minn , used a russian - built saiga 7.62 mm , sks semiautomatic rifle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as this article points out , the sks was n't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10 - year ban on certain " assault weapons " signed by president clinton . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the ban expired in september and at the time of this posting , no one has been killed by any one of those weapons since the ban expired . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
but let 's talk about this case , as i 'm sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
while the media use words like " military style , " " assault " and " semiautomatic , " the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
the sks is a medium -powered carbine equipped with a 10 - round magazine , just like the pistol i 'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds ; so like my small 9 mm , the sks was not classified as an " assault " weapon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so let 's not center our discussion around the gun , let 's talk about the person behind the trigger . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if convicted of the killings , vang faces life in prison as minnesot a does not honor the death penalty . |||O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i look forward to vang 's conviction and i pray for the families of the victims . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
what happened was indefensible and justice must be served . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
here 's an incredible story about an unsung hero until now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a retired italian doctor has revealed for the first time how he invented a fictitious disease which fooled the nazis during world war ii . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the trick of prescribing jews with a mysterious illness terrified the nazis and saved 45 roman jews . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
dr vittorio sacerdoti has told his remarkable tale on the 60th anniversary of liberation of rome . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just 28 years old at the time , he used courage and ingenuity to save 45 people from certain death . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as other jews were being rounded up , dr sacerdoti admitted anyone who could reach the hospital as patients - and diagnosed them with a dangerous disease . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we would write on their medical forms that the patient was suffering from k syndrome , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we called it k after the german commander kesserling - the nazis thought it was cancer or tuberculosis , and they fled like rabbits . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
syndrome saved his cousin , luciana sacerdoti , who was just 10 years old . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" the day the nazis came to the hospital , someone came to our room and said : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
' you have to cough , you have to cough a lot because they are afraid of the coughing , they do n't want to catch an awful disease and they wo n't enter '. " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
scott 2004-12-08t21:33:00 defense secretary donald rumsfeld took part in a q&a with the troops today that was anything but cozy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
disgruntled soldiers complained to rumsfeld about long deployments and a lack of armored vehicles and other equipment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
from the associated press : " you go to war with the army you have , " rumsfeld replied , " not the army you might want or wish to have . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
spc. thomas wilson had asked the defense secretary , " why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to up - armor our vehicles ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
shouts of approval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who had assembled to see rumsfeld . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north , " wilson , 31 , of nashville , tenn. , concluded after asking again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wilson , an airplane mechanic whose unit , the 278th regimental combat team of the tennessee army national guard , is about to drive north into iraq for a one - year tour of duty , put his finger on a problem that has bedeviled the pentagon for more than a year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rarely , though , is it put so bluntly in a public forum . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rumsfeld said the army was sparing no expense or effort to acquire as many humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what is more , he said , armor is not the savior some think it is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" you can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can ( still ) be blown up , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ca n't say that 's the most comforting answer . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
scott 2004-12-15t23:02:00 from the associated press : |||O O O O O O O 
city residents will vote next year on a proposed weapons ban that would deny handguns to everyone except law enforcement officers , members of the military and security guards . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if passed next november , residents would have 90 days to give up firearms they keep in their homes or businesses . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the proposal was immediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
firearms would be allowed only for police officers , security guards , members of the military , and anyone else " actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment , " according to the measure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gun owners of california , a sacramento - based lobbying group , quickly called the ban illegal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sam paredes , the group 's executive director , said state law bars local governments from usurping the state 's authority to regulate firearms . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" the amazing thing is they are going to turn san francisco into ground zero for every criminal who wants to profit at their chosen profession , " paredes said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
washington , d.c. , is the only major american city that currently bans handgun possession by private citizens . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
andrew arulanandam , director of public affairs for the national rifle association , said san francisco would be remiss to use that city as a model . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" if gun control worked , washington , d.c. , would be the beacon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , it 's the murder capital of the united states , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if approved , the weapons ban would take effect in january 2006 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
quote of the day : " firearms would be allowed only for police officers , security guards , members of the military , and anyone else actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so preserving property or life within the scope of self - defense and protection of the home is not allowed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the people vote for this measure it will be hard to sympathize with them when robbery and rape rates skyrocket , because burgulars will know homes are not guarded , and rapists will know the only thing stopping them from the victim they desire is their own inhibitions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no 2nd amendment in the valley |||O O O O O O 
san francisco is apparently bored with just being the gay capital of america and is trying to muscle out washington dc for the prestigious title of murder capital . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's possible , now that san francisco officials have proposed a law that mimics the infamous dc gun ban . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
columnist michelle malkin is one of the few columnists / bloggers who has picked up on the story . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

woman charged with murder , kidnapping fetus - thingy |||O O O O O O O O O 
from the associated press : |||O O O O O 
a baby girl who had been cut out of her mother 's womb was found after a frantic search , and authorities arrested the woman they say strangled the mother and stole the child . |||O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
the baby was in good condition saturday . |||O O O O O O O O

bobbie jo stinnett , 23 , was found thursday in a pool of blood inside her small white home in skidmore , a town in northwest missouri . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
stinnett , who was eight months pregnant , had earlier been talking with her mother on the phone , and hung up saying a woman she had chatted with online had just arrived at her door , authorities said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. attorney todd graves said montgomery contacted stinnett through an online message board , and authorities zeroed in on her using computer forensics . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
montgomery was seeking to buy a dog from stinnett , who raised rat terriers , he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
according to the criminal complaint , montgomery traveled about 40 miles to topeka , kan. , on thursday to go shopping . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
her husband received a call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the next day , authorities say , montgomery confessed that she strangled stinnett from behind , cut her open , removed the baby and cut her umbilical cord . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
i do n't understand how we can call this fetus - thing that was ripped from a mother 's womb a " child " or " girl " in a society that sanctions partial - birth abortion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you ca n't charge someone for killing a fetus via abortion during the eighth month , then surely you ca n't make a big deal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the knifing . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
on a less - sarcastic note , i pray for the family of the 23 - year - old woman . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no one should have to die because some crazy nut wanted a child and decided to kill for it . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
if there 's any good news in this story , it 's that victoria jo will live on and carry her mother 's memory . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
being that it is n't yet the ninth month , can we still charge the killer with kidnapping ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
democrats finally getting it right on abortion ? |||O O O O O O O O 
this is absolutely amazing news . |||O O O O O O 
finally , the democrats are finally realizing that the american people support the rights of unborn children and may soon revamp their platform to accommodate the morals and values that at least half of this country possesses . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course , i 'm sure the democrats would also like to start winning elections again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
from the los angeles times : |||O O O O O O 
after long defining itself as an undisputed defender of abortion rights , the democratic party is suddenly locked in an internal struggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broader array of voters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fight is a central theme of the contest to head the democratic national , particularly between two leading candidates : former vermont gov. howard dean , who supports abortion rights , and former indiana rep . tim roemer , an abortion foe who argues that the party can not rebound from its losses in the november election unless it shows more tolerance on one of society 's most emotional conflicts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no democrat with any respect for his unraveling party would ever mention howard dean 's name again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fact that he did n't win a single primary outside his home state shows that the country does not embrace his radical liberalism . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

despite a desire to curb the sex imbalance and a relaxation in recent years that allows rural families to have two children if the first is a girl , china has shown no sign of abandoning the one - child policy and cracks down on those who advocate against it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

scott 2005-01-09t16:27:00 planned parenthood , one of the worst organizations in the country , has been distributing poor condoms -- which liberals believe should be freely available in all high school clinics nationwide -- according to consumer reports which released its rankings this week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
two of the three types of free condoms offered by planned parenthood received poor ratings , according to rankings that appear in the february issue of consumer reports , which hits newsstands wednesday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the group resubmitted all three of its brands for independent testing and received " excellent results , " said karen pearl , president and chief executive of planned parenthood of nassau county . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the first trackback entry is from the typical anti-christian variety : |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
ms. rytel is absolutely correct , the anti-abortion christians have managed to convice ( sic ) nearly everyone that abortion is wrong and people should feel horribly guilty over it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you 're telling me someone was able to take an ak - 47 " assault rifle " into a mall and injure people ?! |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and because new york has such strict gun laws - meaning citizens are prohibited from concealing weapons - a gunner can use bag - toting shoppers as target practice because guns laws keep mall shoppers at his mercy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O

a brave civilian with a concealed weapons permit tried to stop him but was gunned down by david hernandez arroyo sr , the scumbag who happened to be wearing body armor at the time and who also took out his ex-wife over a child support dispute . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O 
i would n't be surprised if this arroyo character ( who was killed by police as he tried to flee ) had a serious criminal past but has been allowed to walk free due to our lax judicial process . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
should this be a call for more gun control ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
this case tells us two things : that concealed weapons permit holders respond faster than police because we are in greater numbers , and that criminals wear body armor too - so it 's ridiculous to claim that we should outlaw guns that are " too powerful " for civilian use . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
perhaps someone with a five - seven ( the gun the brady campaign calls the " cop - killer " and is trying to ban ) could have been more effective at stopping the armor - wearing gunner . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the single largest political donor in the second half of 2004 was sheila c. johnson , of the plains , who made five contributions totaling $ 320,490 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
( see cpap profile . ) |||O O O O O O 
what 's so special about sheila johnson ? |||O O O O O O O O 
not only is she developing the salamander inn & spa in fauquier county , and not only is she a major philanthropist , but she was a co-founder of of black entertainment television with her ex-husband robert l. johnson . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you have n't figured it out yet , she is an african - american . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know that does n't fit the dominant , minorities - are-still -disenfranchised narrative of the mainstream media . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the old dominion has come a long way , in my humble opinion , when the biggest campaign contributor in the state is african american . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know we 've come along way when african americans are n't just winning elected office , as former gov. douglas wilder did , but they 're bankrolling candidates for office -- white candidates for office . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

werkheiser out - raises opponent and leads challengers statewide |||O O O O O O O O O 
greg werkheiser , candidate for the house of delegates from the 42nd district in southern fairfax county , has raised significantly more money to date than his incumbent opponent , david albo , and leads all challengers statewide in fundraising , according to reports filed with the state board of elections on january 18 , 2005 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

werkheiser now has twice as much unencumbered cash on hand as his opponent : werkheiser $ 50,017 ; albo $ 23,767 |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
werkheiser 's contributions come from 200 individuals ; albo had 8 individual contributors . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
werkheiser leads all challengers statewide in total contributions raised and funds on - hand . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
the 42nd house of delegates district forms the southern tip of fairfax county . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nearly fifty - two percent of the district voted for john kerry in 2004 , and governor mark warner won the district with similar margins in 2001 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
" i am humbled by the support of so many citizens in the 42nd district who are voting with their pocketbooks for a change in leadership . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while we are very pleased with this outpouring of support , i am going to keep doing what i have been doing : listening to my neighbors and working to make our communities in fairfax county a better place to live , work and raise a family , " stated werkheiser . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

" our only agenda is the truth " ) has a chris graham story on a del . chap peterson , d- fairfax , bill that would require payback by companies lured to virginia by incentives if they do not stay for five years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the text of hb2898 is here . |||O O O O O O O 
peterson , of course , is a candidate for the lt. governor nomination . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
graham 's article has the interesting hook of quoting one of peterson 's rivals , former congresswoman and state sen. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
leslie byrne , as approving of the measure because it 's " something that i 've been talking about for some time now . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

demanding accountability from economic development is a rare phenomenon . |||O O O O O O O O O O

one of our bacons rebellion contributors , steven sisson , offers this testimonial : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" without a doubt , the augusta free press is the best thing since sliced bread ! " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hey , what 's this blog , chopped liver ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
if i recall correctly , the last time that virginia seriously addressed the " incentives " issue was during the allen administration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the idea then was to peg incentives to performance : |||O O O O O O O O O O 
if the touted jobs and investment do n't materialize , you lose the tax breaks and incentives . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
by demanding accountability , peterson 's bill is in the spirit of virginia 's existing policy , thought perhaps somewhat tougher . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" hey , what 's this blog , chopped liver ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not a certifiable blogophile yet . |||O O O O O O O O 
in my estimation , the bacon 's rebellion blog is nothing more than " bacon bits " but do n't blog me wrong , because i love bacon bits on salads . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the same might be said of chap 's condiment - packaged business bill . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
petersen bill is nothing more than salt and pepper electioneering in the 2005 statewide campaign -- and is probably tied into the democratic outsourcing clamor and growing threat of more manufacturing plants closing , which john kerry politically contrived and sensationalized for the 04 presidential run . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
residents throughout the commonwealth of virginia and the rest of the nation are economically vulnerable due to free trade agreements and the global economy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but both parties are responsible and have voted in favor of those agreements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lt . governor candidate 's chap peterson and leslie |||O O O O O O O O O 
byrne are both good politicians , but need to start thinking outside the box with legislation that will attract and benefit economic growth for the business world and create sustainable workplaces for virginians . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
will , i agree with your analysis , the va business community along with a majority of ga members will probably deep - six this 5 - year mandatory requirement for compensation due to relocation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if not bordering on the political ridorkulous ( ridiculously dorky ) , it 's just plain ludicrous to believe business owners would agree to a capital investment with strings attached to the businesses health and longevity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
reward - to-punishment - to -reward maybe good dog training techniques , but it 's not very business friendly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the commonwealth needs legislation that requires a mandatory employee stock ownership plan ( esop ) within the contractual economic development agreements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the esop is itself a corporate finance vehicle that provides monetary incentives with lending institutes , state and federal tax benefits , new capital investment , and most of all , the stock ownership plan increases va employee capital wealth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
more capital wealth will drive our consumer - base economy through the flipping roof . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but most importantly , how many virginia businesses will choose to relocate -- or outsource when employee are the corporate stockowners ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and lets say the business has no other choice but to remove to the third world ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when virginia 's employees are fully vested in company stock , they will also reap from the profits of lower wages in the global marketplace just like the corporate big boys . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's win - win -- sort of . |||O O O O O O O O O 
steve sisson said : " lt . governor candidate 's chap peterson and leslie byrne are both good politicians ... " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
define what makes a " good politician ! " |||O O O O O O O O O 
if one defines being on the extreme liberal fringe of the democart party as good , than byrne surely qualifies under that label . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
peterson is slightly to the right of byrne , but not by much ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
frankly , i do n't consider tax and spend liberals as good politicians . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
unfortunately , the republican party is also loaded with its share of irresponsible big spenders , but hopefully some of them will be held accountable during the 2005 primary elections . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

barnie day 2005-02-04t13:26:00 renowned uva political scientist larry sabato this morning announced a $ 1,000,000 cash gift to the university of virginia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O

sabato has written 23 books . |||O O O O O O 
some of them have been read ! |||O O O O O O O 
mostly lifted from the associated press |||O O O O O O 
i 'm not ashamed to say that i 'm in the tank for professor sabato . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he maintains his political independence as well as any pundit and this donation affirms that the words he 's always used to describe his commitment to uva are genuine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he could have moved on to any number of tv or print opportunities , but has stayed in charlottesville to continue his good works . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'd suggest wahoos disenchanted with pete gillen rally around sabato as the embodiment of their university 's excellence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with no web presence , publications like the richmond free press are rarely acknowledged in the blogosphere . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the rfp serves the african - american community in the city of richmond . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the latest edition , staff writer jeremy m . lazarus reports that the legislative black caucus celebrated killing a bill that would have merged the department of minority business enterprise ( dmbe ) with the department of business assistance ( dba ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
del . dwight jones ( d- richmond ) , chair of the caucus , said killing the bill had been their " main objective " in an effort to , according to lazarus , " promote economic justice for black businesses . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i believe any neutral management consultant worth his or her salt would recommend a merger of the two organizations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
there is considerable duplication of effort and dba is strong in one area--financial controls -- where dmbe has consistently had problems . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there would be service benefits to business clients , too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
nonetheless , the symbolism of having their " own " agency and support from governor warner for maintaining dmbe 's " independence " apparently overcame any efficiency and service argument . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
another article , this one by staff writer skeeter faulk , describes sen. george allen 's commitment to naming the new federal courthouse in downtown richmond for spottswood w. robinson iii , a noted naacp lawyer and federal judge . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
robinson worked with thurgood marshall on brown v. board of education . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
faulk finds the nomination a " surprise " in light of allen 's past , when he " embraced and glorified the confederate flag and its sympathizers . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
faulk chalks the naming up to allen 's presidential ambitions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's tough to be a republican when it comes to the african - american community . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do nothing and you confirm their worst suspicions ; do something and it arouses a different kind of suspicion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
will , i share your frustration at the reaction to allen 's nod to spottswood robins . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
among some segments of the african - american community , it is indeed a matter of damned - if - you - do , damned - if - you - do n't . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but you could say the same thing of the democratic party as a whole . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think it 's important to recognize that african americans , though still overwhelmingly democratic , comprise less of a monolith than they did 20 - 30 years ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i find myself continually amazed at how open - minded many young african - americans are . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i think that open-mindedness goes a long way to explain the desperate efforts of many ( not all , but many ) within the democratic party to circle the wagons with the cry of " racism , racism , racism " when the evidence of racism is increasingly a stretch . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's like how , after the civil war , republicans " waved the bloody shirt " , associating the democratic party with the secession and , ultimately , the war itself . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
eventually , that tactic lost its power . |||O O O O O O O O 
and so , too , will the cries of racism , racism . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
more importantly , the lack of disclosure is frightening . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
media general / times dispatch , richmond.com , and the richmond free press all have significant ties to the vpaf 's proposed virginia performing arts center , yet we do not see anything resembling balanced coverage of the controversy and debate surrounding this issue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

states like new jersey are putting solar on school roofs and allowing those schools to earn money even during the summer when they are closed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
virginia is falling behind when we should be ahead with schools like tech developing the technology . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

mickey kaus in slate was listening : |||O O O O O O O 
here 's how npr 's all things considered covered president bush 's proposed cuts in community development block grants -- by lobbing softballs to a cdbg supporter ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is not just liberal , but dumb liberal -- npr could easily have found a democrat , maybe even an old democrat , who believed cdbgs are an ineffective antipoverty program . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( basically they are slush funds for local politicians , who too often sluice the federal money to their developer friends to build ugly downtown hotels . ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's my sense that in virginia , the cdbg program is used extensively in rural areas and , on the whole , has done some good . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
maybe someone knows of cdbg funds used in virginia as mickey describes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i hope not , but , if so , it looks like there wo n't be as much of that in the future . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

choir boy tim kaine is a political moderate informed by his catholic beliefs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but look for the kilgore team to paint him as a liberal for his record on tax hikes and the death penalty . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
the blue dog personally views lt. gov. tim kaine as a moderate - to -conservative politician . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kaine has never been an amway christian , nor does he hold a lifetime membership to the c -e club ( i.e. , only attending church service on christmas and easter holidays ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anonymous ????-??-??t07:49:00 kaine a " moderate to conservative " ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
who is this guy trying to kid ? |||O O O O O O O O 
kaine is as liberal as they come . |||O O O O O O O O 
who other than a left - wing liberal would agree to represent a two - time murderer ( lem tugle ) for free , to try and keep him from getting the death penalty . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
tugle was on trial for raping and killing a southwest virginia grandmother . |||O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O 
after killing her , he dumped her body down the same ditch where he dumped the 17 - year - old girl he had previously been convicted of murdering . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O 
tugle was on parole for this crime when he killed the grandmother . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
i understand that representing people is what attorneys do but even attorneys have some choice in whom they represent . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the line of defense kaine used was that tugle had not really raped the grandmother because " forcable sodomy was not rape according to the law at the time . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
cut acceleration hits a wall |||O O O O O 
as expected the senate finance committee this afternoon killed a proposal by house republicans to finish implementation of the car tax cut by phasing out the remaining 30 % over the next six years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

mickey kaus of slate reminds us that the california initiative bears watching and we should follow the motives of those who support or oppose the current redistricting process . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mickey cites two stuart taylor articles on the subject that should be required reading for any who would debate the issue , here and here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hand in hand with any consideration of the redistricting process , we shoul give some thought to the structural relationship between the state house and senate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
currently , each house member represents approximately 75,000 virginians , while each senator represents appoximately 187,500 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
often as not , there is no rational commonality between the two . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
some senators represent people pools that are in turn fractured into five or six house districts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i believe this accounts , in large part , for the dysfunction that characterizes our state government now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
former governor gerald baliles , in this same vein , has advocated a realignment of the two houses in a way that serves commonalities . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he has suggested that we either increase membership in the senate to 50 , or decrease house membership to 80 , producing a scenario wherein 1 senator would represent a block of people who are represented by exactly 2 delegates . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he thinks -- and i think he is right -- that this arrangement would foster a closer working relationship between the senate and the house . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you certainly would n't have these dysfunctional groupings we now have , where 1 senator often represents a population divided among half a dozen delegates of two parties -- three , if you count independents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if true , these are serious charges , worthy of high - level investigation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what 's missing from the article , though , is any attempt at investigative journalism to give even one factual example supporting the innuendo . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what 's also missing is a fair - minded review of whether the sagging numbers reported for swam procurement are valid . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
someday a journalist is going to take the time to watch a sample number of swam firms submit bids on openly posted contracts , then use procurement tools that are in place to determine if any swam firms were unfairly denied contracts they deserved . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
until then , this carping appears to be sour grapes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O

by the time of his death , he was down to his last $ 1 billion , according to israeli-intelligence estimates.arafat wife suha 's outburst that his successors were " trying to bury [ him ] alive " came after she learned that arafat had signed over at least $ 800 million to the government of the palestinian authority two years ago , time reports . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist marwan barghouti marwan barghouti ( born june 6 , 1958 ) is a palestinian leader from the west bank and a leader of the fatah movement that forms the backbone of the palestinian authority and the palestine liberation organization ( plo ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on june 6 , 2004 , he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against israeli civilians . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O 
barghouti was one of the major leaders of the first intifada in 1987 , leading palestinians in a mass uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
during the uprising , he was arrested by israel and deported to jordan , where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the oslo accords in 1994 . |||O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
in 1996 , he was elected to the palestinian legislative council , in which he advocated peace with israel , sometimes coming in conflict with yasser arafat . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the formal position occupied by barghouti was the general secretary of fatah in the west bank . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
by the summer of 2000 , barghouti and arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other , with barghouti accusing arafat 's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations , and arafat was planning to fire him shortly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
however , as the second intifada began , barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the fatah tanzim militia . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this was perhaps due to the transformation of tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like hamas and islamic jihad , responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive - by shootings . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O

after they hoisted the soldier in the truck , the two iraqis -- one an officer , the other an nco -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated , everybody who could talk was questioned about their health . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
when the medics came to the two iraqis , the ing soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when asked why did they do it , they simply stated , " this was our duty ; we are a team , and we take care of each other . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no matter what the msm tries to tell you , there are iraqi 's who will help the allies , who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure democracy succeeds in their country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this brings to mind a speech prime minister tony blair gave recently while visiting iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
when i meet the people working alongside the united nations -- iraqis in fear of their life every day , because they are trying to bring freedom and democracy to their people -- when i see their courage and their determination and know that they speak for the vast majority of people in iraq who want that democracy and freedom , then i know that we are doing the right thing . . . . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i will also say this to you : |||O O O O O O O O O 
there are people dying in iraq , but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
now what should our response be as an international community ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
our response should be to stand alongside the democrats -- the people who 've got the courage to see this thing through -- and help them see it through . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sometimes when i see some of the reporting of what 's happening in iraq in the rest of the world , i just feel that people should understand how precious what has been created here is . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and those people from that electoral commission that i described as the heroes of the new iraq -- every day . . . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a lot of them are n't living in the green zone , they 've got to travel in from outside . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they do not know at any point in time whether they 're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation , even death , and yet they carry on doing it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
now what a magnificent example of the human spirit -- that 's the side we should be on . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this recent news story is troubling in many different ways . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
when i first heard of the story i figured it was some wackjob playing with a new toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since christmas from the west to east coast . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fbi , concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons , is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since christmas . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fbi is looking into two incidents in colorado springs , colo. , and one each in cleveland , washington , houston , teterboro , n.j. , and medford , ore. , according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials , some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a federal law enforcement official , who declined to be identified by name , said thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
but pilots are troubled by the incidents , and the fbi earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
" it 's not some kid , " said paul rancatore , a pilot who serves as deputy chairman of the security committee for the allied pilots association . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
loren thompson , who teaches military technology at georgetown university , called it a " rather worrisome development , " though he said experts would be more puzzled than alarmed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" what we 're talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laser that has the ability to lock onto a fast - moving aircraft , " thompson said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" that 's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store . " |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O 
thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the fbi suspects would be " fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" it sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents , " thompson said . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
michelle malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
lots of people think that these indeed might be loonies playing with new christmas toys but i disagree . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these are incidents where the airplanes were tracked , some as high as 8500 feet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not be some toy you can get from the local wal - mart . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in my opinion this is quite alarming . |||O O O O O O O O 
this is n't writing , it 's typing has a great post out with a ton of info , some of it quite scary a more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a chinese - produced zm - 87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
the japanese terrorist cult aum shinrikyo -- which launched the infamous sarin gas attack on the tokyo subway system in 1995 -- was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons.according to the asian pacific post , " cult members apparently obtained laser design information from russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
they had planned to use the laser against tokyo policemen , but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage . " |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
politicalex also has some info on this story also . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i found the following report that was presented to congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners , which this might very well be a precursor to : recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface - to - air missiles ( sams ) , referred to as man - portable air defense systems ( manpads ) , pose to commercial airliners . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
instead , a menu of options may be considered , including installing infrared ( ir ) countermeasures on aircraft ; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures ; improving airport and regional security ; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground - based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , this option has a relatively high cost , between $ 1 million and $ 3 million per aircraft , and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training , altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat , and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
however , these techniques by themselves can not completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect u.s. airliners flying to and from foreign airports . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
legislation introduced in the 108th congress ( h.r. 580 , s. 311 ) calls for the installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while this legislation is still under consideration , homeland security appropriations designated $ 60 million in fy2004 and $ 61 million in fy2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is anticipated that at the conclusion of this program , in january 2006 , the department of homeland security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the suitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
curt 2005-01-01t22:44:00 american future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays houston chronicle . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it describes how the european governments look to be changing their tune in regards to president bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
from a european perspective , three things are making it easier to warm to the bush white house . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one is the death of yasser arafat . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O 
no issue divides europe and the united states more keenly than the israeli- palestinian dispute . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for the last few years , europeans have criticized bush for failing to put enough pressure on israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with arafat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that another reason why i respect bush so much , his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist arafat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
may he rot in hell . |||O O O O O O 
but since arafat 's death , europeans and americans have been able to find common ground : supporting ariel sharon 's withdrawal from gaza , putting pressure on israel to let the palestinians hold elections and , covertly , backing mahmoud abbas to become the next palestinian leader . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a second reason is europe 's growing worries about islamic terrorism . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the murder in november of theo van gogh , a provocative dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an islamic militant has been called europe 's 9/11 . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
though the two events are obviously not fully comparable , it is certainly true that american conservatives , such as francis fukuyama and bernard lewis , have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical islam is inimical to european traditions of tolerance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
keep doing business like the cowards in spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the third force is the reappearance , albeit in a milder form , of the threat that kept the trans - atlantic alliance together for half a century . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the russian bear is growling again . |||O O O O O O O 
the ukrainian election --- complete with its kgb - style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy - handed electoral fraud -- has reminded european diplomats of vladimir v . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
putin 's determination to control his " near abroad . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
they should be very worried about this item , i believe putin is slowly sliding russia back to what it once was . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hopefully our government is n't asleep at the wheel with this situation either . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there is a personal edge to all this . |||O O O O O O O O O 
just as the snooty continentals eventually came to admire the gormless hollywood actor , there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the inarticulate texan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
many european leaders once swallowed the michael moore version of history : that bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the white house . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
his thumping re-election , however , shows that he represents a large body of conservative american opinion . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in short , europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not bush who is the exception , but the u.s. itself that is exceptional --- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
strangely enough , this has been tony blair 's strategy all along ; it is rapidly becoming the continent 's strategy , too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
could n't of ended that article any better myself . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
get used to it france , we ai n't going nowhere . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nicolae mischie , authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party , has been jailed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
romania voted in the last december , ousting the so - called socialist party psd ( social - democratic party ) . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
psd managed to keep a stronghold in poor rural areas , with the help of people like mischie . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they combined blackmail , using their right of decision regarding the public funds for local leaders opposing psd , and strong seduction of the uneducated masses , in a marvelous way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mischie , who talks like an idiot , got a phd in history . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
his paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and mischie bought the house where his paper 's subject lived . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
maybe he tried to invest in his paper , maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning phds , but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable leader . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
another misleading sign was his position as a university professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities , which are still ways to buy diplomas here in romania . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
local leaders did their jobs , but national leaders , pressuring tv stations to lie , associating with old communist ex-president ion iliescu , failed to win in big cities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
psd is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
it is known that communist leaders die in office ( as judges of the u.s. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
supreme court ) and ion iliescu wo n't be different . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
all the leaders that expressed different points of view will be excluded from the party , that 's the untold truth that romanian media seem to hide or not conceive yet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mischie was right to criticize the national leaders , because psd got a good share in the elections in his area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
but mischie was wrong , because he did that while in vacation in switzerland , where you ca n't go if you earn 20 k $ a year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the new power had nothing to do , but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iliescu and nastase , ex-president and ex-prime minister , are now left only with the leadership of the party and holding this illusory authority . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if mischie would n't take his chance on them , he would still be free , with the help of the weak and weakening strings iliescu might still pull . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the interim government declared a state of emergency in iraq excluding the kurdish region for 60 days , according to the national security law introduced last august which states that emergency laws can be declared in the country for a period no more than 60 days provided a serious threat against iraqi national security is recognised by the interim government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
obviously , this is a necessary step that should have been taken at least two months ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suicide bombings and guerrilla attacks carried out by insurgents and foreign terrorists based around baghdad have escalated to alarming levels particularly during ramadan . |||B-TRI B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
deputy governor of diyala along with several council members from ba' quba were ambushed and killed in latifiya south of baghdad , an area which has supposedly been ' cleared ' from insurgents a couple of weeks ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
four suicide attacks in samarra , also a recently ' liberated ' area , against national guard units and the governorate building . |||O B-TRI B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
zarqawi 's group claimed responsibility for the attacks . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
three police stations in haditha , a small town west of ramadi , were assaulted by groups of insurgents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
some 30 policemen were captured , tied up and executed in cold blood against the walls following a confrontation which lasted two hours . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
zarqawi 's group , again , claiming responsibility . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a full - scale military operation against fallujah , which is apparently underway already , seems to be the government 's ' final solution ' . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not optimistic to the outcome , especially when significant civilian casualties are unavoidable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
note , that i 'm not suggesting a peaceful or political solution would work either in these areas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
insurgents west of baghdad have quite obstinately made it clear that nothing but full control of the country , or at least the anbar governorate , will satisfy them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have refused to participate in the political process , they have repeatedly announced their intentions to boycott the elections and to disrupt them in other areas , and they do not recognise the government or any other authority in the country beside themselves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the demands of the fallujah negotiants from the government weeks ago were obscene and they clearly reflect the overt sectarianism and regionalism of the armed groups in the area . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the demands were not released to the iraqi public at the time for unkown reasons but they have leaked out days ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here are just a few of them : |||O O O O O O O O 
- a clear timetable for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces ( fair enough ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- immediate withdrawal of us and iraqi security forces from the anbar governorate and the handover of security responsibilities to former army officers from anbar . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- the appointment of ministers from the anbar governorate to the ministries of interior , defense , oil and finance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- the removal of certain officials ( most of them from shi'ite islamic parties such as ibrahim al - ja'fari ) from governmental positions . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- the complete return of ba'athists , army officers , republican guards , mukhabarat , intelligence and security personnel to their former positions . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
- the removal of shi'ite edhan ( call for prayers ) from official television and radio programs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- incomes of shi'ite sacred shrines should be returned under the control of the ministry of endowments and religious affairs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these last two demands have been allegedly added by sheikh harith al - dhari ( head of the association of muslim scholars ) and are said to have been a major reason behind the failure of negotiations with the government . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iraqis here in the south were shocked to hear of these demands and sectarian tensions are on the rise . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it scares me to see the reaction of people around me whenever fallujah is mentioned . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the director of a primary health care clinic was remarking the other day that " fallujah should be burnt upon its residents and then razed to the ground . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are the sons of mu'awiya , may allah curse them all . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sidenote : mu'awiya bin abi sufyan was the governor of syria during the 7th century and he fought imam ali bin abi talib ( muhammed 's son - in - law ) over the caliphate after the assassination of caliph othman . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
he became the first ummayid caliph and two decades later , under the caliphate of his son yazid , imam hussein bin ali ( grandson of muhammed ) was killed by his armies at present day karbala . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
someone hushed the director and pointed out to him that i 'm sunni . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was a bit embarrassed and tried to explain that he was referring to wahhabis and foreign fighters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it was a bit uncomfortable and i could feel that people were giving me furtive glances . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
refugees have been pouring out of fallujah over the last few days into baghdad and the surrounding areas . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the military operation will undoubtly aggravate the humanitarian situation inside the city since there are definitely thousands of families with no place to go . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
refugees in baghdad have confirmed the rumours that the ' mujahideen ' are forcing men from 15 - 50 years old to stay and that they were threatened with execution if they refuse to carry arms in defense of the town . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( the mujahideen advisory council ) are in control of fallujah and they have distributed a statement inviting arab and foreign ( including american ) media reporters to enter the town and cover the battles . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the statement carried the insignia of zarqawi 's group qa'idat al - jihad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
everyone is closely watching what the next few days will bring , hoping the violence does n't spread to the streets of baghdad or other areas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm still holed up in basrah but i 'll try to be on the road as soon as possible . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
daylight savings time is retarded |||O O O O O 
mark backer 2004-11-03t13:00:00 i am 36 years old . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i 've been around a while . |||O O O O O O O 
i 'm not 87 or anything , but i 've seen some things in my life . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have initially agreed and disagreed with different things over the years , only to have my mind changed later . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , i will never ever change my mind about the idiocy we call daylight savings time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i googled " daylight savings time " and i got the following link : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the site says things like " we 've learned to save energy and enjoy sunny summer evenings by switching our clocks an hour forward in the summer " and there 's no s at the end of savings . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it should be daylight saving time . |||O O O O O O O 
my apologies to the assclowns that invented this idiocy and the goobers that perpetuate it in such a ridiculous fashion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i will concede that " springing forward " and " falling back " are good ways to remember to change the batteries in your smoke detectors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , new years and the fourth of july would do the same thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i kept reading the website of propoganda and found that the first person to come up with the idea was benjamin franklin who did it on behalf of some friends that owned oil companies ( oil was used in lamps ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i assume that , because the idea was dumb and inconvenient , lots of people ignored it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" by 1966 , some 100 million americans were observing dst based on their own local laws and customs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
congress decided to step in to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the uniform time act of 1966 ( 15 u.s. code section 260 a ) which was signed into public law 89-387 on 12 april 1966 , by president lyndon johnson , created daylight saving tim to begin on the last sunday of april and to end on the last sunday of october . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
any state that wanted to be exempt from dst could do so by passing a state law . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's a lot more to this since then , and you can read a lot more it if you want to , but this is what i know : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
indiana 's eastern half does n't use it . |||O O O O O O O O O 
arizo na does n't use it because one tribe of indians stretches into three states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but those other states do use it . |||O O O O O O O O 
hawaii does n't use it at all . |||O O O O O O O O 
of course , they 're closer to japan than to us , and since japan does n't use it , hawaii just plays along . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( do you think the hawaiian 's sit around , staring west , just becuase they still do n't trust the japs ? ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
regardless of when i go to bed ( 11 pm or 10 pm or 9 pm ) , i get up at 5:30 and i am fucking exhausted . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i slept the same number of hours as i did two weeks ago , yet i 'm tired ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also , i am so hungry i could eat my little tub of carmex by 10:30 am every day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i used to eat lunch between 11:30 and noon , but now , eating is all i think about after 10 am . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
why is that good for me ? |||O O O O O O O 
i do n't care if america saves 1 % of its energy consumption costs during those times . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i am tired , hungry , and i leave for work and get home from work in the dark . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
for that matter , i do n't care about any of the pro-farming or anti-crime propoganda . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , if you 'll excuse me , i have to go stalk the lobby for the girls that are bringing me my krystals . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
order and fight to keep myself from falling asleep in my cube . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
about time you realized daylight savings time is the work of satan 's minions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you would feel comfortable in china , then ; it 's the same time everywhere . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and so it 's come down to this ... |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's auburn - georgia week , ladies and gentlemen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
after all the smack talk that 's gone on for the last 360 days , and all of the games that both teams have played and the hopes each had for the 2004 season , it 's come down to this . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to stay undefeated and alive for a chance at the bcs title game , auburn must win this saturday in it 's 3:30 est game on cbs against the georgia bulldogs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if they hope to move up from their current number five ranking and keep the hope alive of playing in the sec title game in december , georgia must beat auburn . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this game is as good as it gets . |||O O O O O O O O O 
sure , auburn 's in - state rival is alabama , but year in and year out , this game , the auburn - uga game , seems like the one that matters more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i seldom if ever root for bama , but i always root for uga to be undefeated when the play auburn . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the game is big enough already , but it seems even bigger when one or both teams have something on the line . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yes , both teams have other games left to play and yes , other teams ' results may affect what happens to both of these teams , but in just five days , these two teams will play the biggest and most important game of their season . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so now it 's time for all of the yapping and jawing and talking shit that goes with this game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
except i do n't do that . |||O O O O O O O 
anytime i try to talk shit , i get all nauseous and worry about what happens not if but when we lose . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't know if it 's just me or if being this pragmatic is what it means to be an auburn fan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i wonder if deep down this is what it feels like to be a red sox fan : regardless of where you are or what is happening to your team , deep down you do n't just think , you know something bad is going to happen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyway , i am flying my flag on my house with pride and i am looking forward to the game that , year in and year out , gives us the best hitting and mos entertaining football played on the highest level . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's sec football at it 's core . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's now just one day until i hop in the car and head back in time to the loveliest village on the plains ... auburn , alabama . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have n't been back since 1994 and when i was talking to my wife about the trip this morning , it seems like a lifetime ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hell , it 's been half my life since i was in school there and over two thirds of my adult life , assuming that people that know me think my adult life has actually started yet . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyway , enough nostalgia from me , at least for now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the wife and i were watching sportscenter this morning , and lee corso , mark may and trev alberts were all picking auburn to beat georgia , and the last two were picking them to run the table for the right to play usc for the national championship . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then , i open the atlanta paper this morning , and everything is pro-uga . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , i knew it would be , but some of it was even based on facts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when auburn and their opponent are both in the top ten , auburn is 4 - 6 - 1 in those games . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn has lost the last three games that fit that scenario . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn 's last defeat came at the hands of ... uga . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn does lead the overall record in the series 51 - 46 - 8 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , the road team 's record in this series . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
at auburn , uga is 11 - 8 - 2 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
at athens , auburn is 17 - 8 . |||O O O O O O O O O 
this trend was serious in the 80's , with the road team winning about two - thirds of the time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the only time this changed recently really was when uga decided to win in their place in 2003 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the upside , auburn has scored at least 33 points in the last six games . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's a pretty nice run . |||O O O O O O O 
auburn leads the sec in scoring offense , scoring defense and rushing defense . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn is second in the nation in scoring defense and seventh in pass defense . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jason campbell is 3rd in the nation in passing efficiency while david greene is 10th . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here are a couple of middle of the road stats : |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn 's quentin groves and georgia 's david pollack are tied for the sec sack lead . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here 's the biggest for what it 's worth stat as far as i am concerned : both teams are undefeated this year when scoring first . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn is 8 - 0 and uga is 5 - 0 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'd say that 's the biggest stat right now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn 's offense is potent and efficient . |||O O O O O O O O 
uga 's defense is relentless and contains a couple of the country 's biggest hitters , especially greg blue and odell thurman . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn 's defense is fast and relentless and the db 's are experienced and big . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uga 's receivers are leaders , with one of them a team captain . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn 's two running backs are seniors and very experienced and dangerous , bruising backs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
uga 's two backs are smaller freshmen with less experience , but are dangerous as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in my mind , the game is going to turn on a few key points , some obvious and some not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here goes the prediction machine : |||O O O O O O 
- turnovers ( as always ) will be critical . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
- special teams play and lack of special teams mistakes will tell the tale regarding field position . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- both teams must establish the run to be successful . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
if auburn goes for 150 between their two backs , they 're almost impossible to beat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
conversely , georgia must be able to run the ball to set up play action and keep the pressure off of david greene . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
- mark richt has proven to be a better on the fly adjustment coach that tommy tuberville . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tubs is famous for taking chances , often unnecessary ones . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
that history is of concern to me . |||O O O O O O O O 
while it 's okay to try crazy shit when your team is under - rated or a serious underdog , it 's important not to give games away when you 're the favorite . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
playing more " by the book " and a bit " closer to the vest " becomes the call for the day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
considering all of these factors , i truly believe that this is auburn 's year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they may not go undefeated and they may not get into the bcs title game , but they have enough talent , poise and experience to win this game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now that i have typed that prediction , i may just throw up in my mouth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
added at 1:28 pm on 11/12/04 |||O O O O O O 
david greene is the winningest qb in ncaa division i history !! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and he 's 15 - 1 on the road !! |||O O O O O O O O O O 
putting the cart before the horse ... |||O O O O O O O 
you know , for the past five days and really for about the past fifteen or twenty days , i 've been angry about the bcs rankings and why auburn is n't ranked higher and all of that business . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
can someone tell me why one of my friends or family members has n't smacked me because of it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
i mean , here we are , 10 - 0 and staring down the barrell of a road game at tuscaloosa against our hated rivals , the alabama crimson tide , and i 'm bitching about how we better get to play for a national title ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you do n't have to think back too far to find a similar scenario , only with the shoe firmly on the other foot . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in 1989 , alabama was 10 - 0 , number two in the nation and coming into auburn for the first time ever to play at jordan - hare stadium . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all the talk for the weeks leading up to the game was about " if bama 's undefeated , they 'll play for it all in the sugar bowl " and other crap like that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , " if or when " never happened because auburn won 30 - 20 in one of the greatest iron bowl games ever , putting an end to bama 's national title hopes for the year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
15 years later , the situation 's reversed . |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's auburn that 's undefeated and facing the road game at the end of the season . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suddenly , i 'm about nauseous about this game too . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
despite being riddled with injuries , alabama has a ridiculously stout defense , recently ranked as the number one defense in the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
has all of the bluster and talking shown up on the plains as well ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i only hope that coach tuberville has been successful at keeping his players focused , motivated and thinking about only the alabama game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do people never learn from the mistakes of others ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
for those of you not from around these parts , linda schrenko was the state of georgia 's superintendant of schools . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it seems that in recent years , instead of doing the people 's business , good ole linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in federal education funds . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
she used it for various things , but the favorite is the nine grand she spent on a facelift . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here 's a link to the story : |||O O O O O O O O 
one thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
ummm , am i the only one that learned anything from the michael irvin drug trial of the mid 90's ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
you never ever show up at court , especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money , wearing a fucking fur coat !! |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
fake or not , you look like you 're rubbing the common man 's nose in it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
schrenko is a scumbag and , although she wo n't get any actual jail time , i hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
remember when michael milken got busted , he was not forced to give up his secret accounts , and when the fine of 600 million was levied ... he paid it !! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
hell , at his zenith , that 's what he made in one year !! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , lemme just get my checkbook out of my diamond encrusted briefcase . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
schrenko stole 20 times what martha stewart did , and i bet she wo n't see the wrong side of a jail cell door , and that 's sad . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because it 's people like schrenko for which jails were specifically designed ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , it 's mid-morning on the east coast and i am sitting here running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what 's going to happen in the iron bowl , which is just over 29 hours away . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the game is being played in tuscaloosa , which should be an advantage to alabama . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , in the two times the game has been played in bryant denny stadium , auburn has won . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alabama has one of the stingiest defenses in the country , and were ranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
conversely , auburn has one of the most potent and balanced offensive attacks in the nation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also , i do n't think bama has faced an attack with two great runners , a great line , a poised qb and good receivers and a tight end as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bama is missing it 's starting offensive backfield from the start of the season . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fact that they 've won six games is a testament to the coaching and heart of the players . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
alabama simply can not throw the football , which is a good thing , because auburn 's defensive backfield is second to none . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bama can run the ball however . |||O O O O O O O 
unfortunately for them , with no passing game to keep the defense honest , auburn will probably stack nine in the box , play man on the corners , and dare bama to run , and i do n't think they 'll be able to do it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn is also 9 - 0 when they score first . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the tuberville way is to get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you 're at home and to quiet the other team 's crowd if you 're on the road . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in this exact game 15 years ago , bama came into auburn # 2 in the country , undefeated at 10 - 0 and looking for yet another national championship . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they were summarily trounced 30 - 20 in a game in which the score was closer than the actual game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that could very well happen saturday . |||O O O O O O O 
i always tell people that the georgia game matters more to me than the bama game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i live in georgia , and losing that game affects me much more directly than losing the alabama game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that said , when kickoff time comes , you remember all the reasons that you hate alabama and their dumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and their houndstooth hats and their " bear this " and " bear that , " and everything else that goes along with it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is n't a football game , and it 's not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
this is brother against brother after one slept with the other 's wife and then bragged about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , when it 's all said and done , i just do n't think alabama has the horses to stand up to what i believe is going to be enormous defensive pressure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if auburn takes care of the ball and executes , this game should n't be as close as some think . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't feel so well ... |||O O O O O O O 
there 's not " holiday " in this holiday weekend ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
we have been on the go since about noon on wednesday and even longer in the wife 's case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she started cleaning about a week before the holiday and cleaned for about two weeks right thru the holiday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we spent friday doing a little shopping and got to bed early , but saturday was busy with football watching . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not as a people , but as a football team . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the looked good for 15 minutes , but then they got run over by matt leinert and usc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have no beef with usc being number one , but oklahoma is nowhere close to number two in the country , and i am sick of the pollsters who only look at east coast scores instead of watching tape of the games . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn has trailed in exactly two games this year , and has given up less than 9.5 points per game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oklahoma has given up bucketloads of points , but still gets some mystery respect for it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
( i know many of you may be tired of my rants about this , have no fear . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 'll all be over by next sunday night or monday morning . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at that point , we 're either in or fucked and either way , i 'm writing about it once then , and that will be it ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyway , we decided to go ahead and get a fake tree yesterday , and we got that bad boy put up yesterday and are decorating it today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we also got all of our exterior lights up today , marking the first time this family has ever had their decorating done by thanksgiving sunday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
big kudos to the missus . |||O O O O O O 
it feels weird not watching racing today , but it 'll get easier and then , come january 10th or so , there 'll be testing news and driver signing news and we 'll be on the back side of the remaining 84 days until the daytona 500 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
until tomorrow kids , war eagle !! |||O O O O O O O 
mark backer 2004-12-02t07:11:00 apparently jason giambi , recently the non -playing and " sick " first baseman of the new york yankees , admitted to a grand jury that he " injected anabolic steroids and human growth hormone ( hgh ) as recently as 2003 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and he apparently got them thru balco and ( surprise ) the same guy that is barry bonds ' trainer , once greg anderson . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
since that grand jury testimony was given , giambi repeatedly denied using any steroids , hgh , or anything else to anyone and everyone that would listen . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jason 's brother jeremy also admitted to the grand jury that he used steroids . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , barry is denying he 's done any steroids and gary sheffield 's denying he 's done any steroids , but one by one , the lesser ( and bigger ) players in this deal are seeing their testimony coming into the the public eye where they admitted that they did do steroids . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it seems that anyone associated with this special " trainer " greg anderson is coming up dirty . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a good thing that major league baseball has such a tough steroid policy , or this story may not have been brought to our attention . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
never mind if the steroids and human growth hormones were illegal in baseball or not . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are illegal to use in the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i want to know where the federal criminal charges against all parties involved are . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the fact that these guys ( sheff , the giambis , marion jones , bonds and many others ) are running around denying this shit and acting like pete rose did any time someone asked him about gambling ( getting uber defensive , denying it implicitly and acting like the person asking had personally assaulted him ) is appalling . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these clowns are messing with people 's careers by insisting they 're being lied about , yet when it turns out the reporters were n't lying and the athletes were , nothing is done . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have never denied that barry bonds was a special and gifted athlete . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
whether it 's steroids , hgh , crank , lighter fluid or antifreeze he 's using , being able to perform at this level for this length of time defies logic or reason . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's why it 's a shame that , in the final analysis , all of bonds ' numbers and accomplishments are going to be ignored and lumped into the statement " yeah , but he was on steroids . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a pity he and the others are too dumb to see that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now , just so you do n't think that every entry in this blog will be like the one above , here 's a great joke i read today : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a man takes his rottweiler to the vet and says , " my dog 's cross -eyed , is there anything you can do for him ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" well , " says the vet , " let 's have a look at him . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so he picks the dog up and examines his eyes , then checks his teeth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
finally , the vet says " i 'm going to have to put him down . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" no , because he 's really heavy . " |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i will be breaking down the sec championship game either later today or tomorrow , so i expect you all to be planted firmly on the edge of your seats waiting for that one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hey , look who got screwed ... |||O O O O O O O 
i am having a difficult time putting my feelings into words right now , so bear with me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
first of all , i want to congratulate the auburn football team for doing what no other auburn football team has done ; going 12 - 0 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they also won their first outright sec title since 1987 and won their first sec title since the conference implimented the championship game format . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a year ago , the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over -zealous and too empowered booster with a fat checkbook . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
since that day , the team is undefeated and has won 14 games in a row . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have now beated four teams that were in the top 15 at the time the games were played , and two of those games were won away from jordan - hare stadium . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on championship weekend , the big three all played . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
usc won by five over a shitty ucla team with a 6 - 5 record , and that was thanks in part to an official who blew dead a clear and obvious fumble that would have been returned for a ucla touchdown . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
oklahoma played in it 's conference title game against a four -loss colorado team that ca n't throw the ball . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the result was a 40 plus point beatdown , but what did anyone expect ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn played 15th ranked tennessee and was attempting to do one of the toughest things to do in college football : beating a team twice in the same year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with the exception of a 15 yard shanked punt and a punt snap that kody bliss missed while having an apparent thrombosis , auburn led 21 - 7 at the half and had held ut to 46 yards of offense . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while the auburn running game was held up , jason campbell threw it all over the ball field and , when his receivers were covered , he ran for yardage on his own . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this despite several late hits to the head , low hits at his knees and ankles , and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a touchdown , since the ball clearly touched the turf , and that 's where the momentum of the game changed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think it was also at that point that the scoreboard began to reflect auburn 's last title hopes dying as the oklahoma - colorado score would have begun showing the beat - down that was occuring . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn was tied 21 - 21 and in jeapordy of losing it most important game ever , but senior qb jason campbell would have none of it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn won going away 38 - 28 , and the only place the game looked close was on the scoreboard . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i ca n't believe that an undefeated sec team is not playing for a title , but i guess we can thank jeff sagarin and the other dicks that keep voting usc number one to make up for what happened to them last year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all i know is that they better think that way next year , because it 's auburn that got screwed this year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and what 's better is that auburn gets to play one of the three hottest teams in the country in my opinion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tech is talented , very athletic and one of the most well coached teams in the country and they will come to play on january 3 rd . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i hope our kids can shake off this travesty and focus on making the pollsters look like idiots . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
maybe an oklahoma win in a butt -ugly game and a great auburn performance could help . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what 's the definition of pragmatic ? |||O O O O O O O 
going undefeated and chanting " we 're number two !! " |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm reading espn this morning when i stumbled across the story where kobe bryant said he 'd like to sit down with shaq and apologize to him for " involving him in my troubles . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bryant also says that he thinks december 25th " sounds like a good day to me to kind of talk to him and tell him i never meant in any kind of way to bring any of his personal business out . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you see , after kobe 's world fell apart because he could n't resist banging the crazy white towel clerk at his hotel , he needed an out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he bought his wife a four million dollar ring and got some tattoos that said how much he loved her , but he needed to do more to attract attention away from himself . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so he told the media that he should have done what shaq always did , just pay the women to shut up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
kobe also alleged that o'neal had paid upwards of one million dollars in this way as hush money over the years . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
shaq has denied it from the beginning , but that 's not really the point . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's no secret that a large number of the nba 's " stars " are not exactly star-worthy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
good players or not , guys like kemp and bryant and iverson and the entire blazers team are just not very nice or good people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the league will tolerate it , what do i care ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the real issue is this . |||O O O O O O O 
kobe 's lakers will play shaq 's miami heat on ... that 's right ... december 25th . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so the real motivation for kobe here is not to mend fences or admit he was wrong to involve any other person in his own little pit of woe . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is to find some sort of way to keep the 340 - pound shaquille and his teammates from beating the ever - loving shit out of kobe for 48 pain - filled minutes on christmas day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i ca n't tell you the number of ways that kobe bryant makes me sick . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
despite his slick talk and his nice diction , he 's nothing but a cheater and a liar and a punk . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i hardly watch any nba games because the league and most of it 's players sicken me , but i 've had december 25th circled on my calendar since the day after shaq signed with the heat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's the day that shaq will take a million dollars or more out of kobe 's punk - ass . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sorry i have n't been posting much lately . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we have been so damned busy with the holidays ( that 's what we call december at our house ) that i just have n't had time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i read a funny joke today and i thought i 'd share it with you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one of my fellow eggers posted it , so chet , here 's your credit : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a traveler was driving through arkansas when he lost his way and got off the main highway . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as he drove by , he saw rows and rows of pigsties and pigpens and pigs running in fields and pigs wallowing in mud . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
suddenly , his eye caught something really strange . |||O O O O O O O O O 
he did a double take , muttered to himself and then looked a third time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he wondered if he had seen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farmyard , where he was met by the farmer . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" excuse me , " the traveler said . |||O O O O O O O O O 
" i was just driving by and looking at all your pigs , and i noticed something that i just had to stop and ask about . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tell me , did i see right ? |||O O O O O O O O 
is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" oh , that would be old caesar you saw . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - and smart ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , let me tell you a little about that pig . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you see that barge down there on the river ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's a mining dredge , taking out platinum ore . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
old caesar sniffed out the vein and showed us how to set it up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now that dredge brings me in about $ 120,000 every year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" there 's another thing , too , a little more personal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one night a couple of years ago i got to drinking and i guess i had more than i should have . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i passed out drunk , fell down and knocked over a lamp . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that started a fire in the house and old caesar smelled the smoke . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he came in the back door , got the wife and kid out , roused me up and got me out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" there is no question about it - that night old caesar saved all our lives and you know that is not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" why , " the traveler said , " this is all amazing ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have never heard of a pig like this before ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
but tell me , how did he get that wooden leg ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
was he in a wreck or something ? " |||O O O O O O O O O 
the farmer laughed and said , " well , naturally , when you have a pig that smart , you do n't want to eat him all at one time ! " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
did anyone see the packers game sunday ? |||O O O O O O O O 
while it was entertaining , that 's not why i 'm posting about it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't normally post about pro football , but what i saw deserved a ranting or two , and i suspect it 's going to get many more in the days and weeks to come . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with 4:41 left in the fourth quarter and the packers down by 11 , favre hit robert ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash marks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
coming from the other direction , jacksonville db donovin darius unloaded chin high on ferguson with a vicious clothesline . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
ferguson held on to the ball , despite being disjoined from his helmet on the hit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after many minutes lying motionless on the field , ferguson was finally removed via stretcher , giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the packers went on to lose the game , but that 's not the story here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this was not one of the staged stiff - armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this was a vicious , arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn ferguson 's head off of his body . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the play was immediately flagged , and moments later it was announced that darius had been ejected , much to the crowd 's delight . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one sidenote here is that , despite their rabid fandom and the situation , not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
it would have been easy to bathe him in beer or snowballs or batteries as he left , but the packer fans are classier than that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to a person , they acted with class , using their voices and not projectiles to express their displeasure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play i have seen in the nfl since jim mcmahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80 's about five seconds after he had released a pass . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and jaguars coach jack del rio and darius had the nerve to vociferously argue with officials about darius ' ejection from the game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't care what anyone says about " you ca n't judge intent . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
darius ' intent was to dismember , injure or even kill ferguson . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the more i saw the replay , the sicker it made me feel . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the league must take action , and it must be swift and sure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm talking about a four game suspension that included the playoffs if necessary . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in this day and age of bigger , stronger and faster players , injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
there is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in ferguson 's injury . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
paul tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
maybe that will tell the jaguars , darius and players like him that this kind of head - hunting will not be tolerated in the nfl . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if not , i fully expect the packers and many other teams to handle this matter " on the field " with darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
i forgot to tell you this ... |||O O O O O O O 
mark backer 2005-01-03t08:29:00 i was on vacation from december 23rd until today , january 3rd . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's tough to come back to work after being gone for ten days , but i think it 's tougher to stay home and try to do what my wife does every day , which is work , raise our daughter , keep the house , cook , and everything else . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , the thing i forgot to tell you was that when i walked out of the office to go home on the 23rd , there was a pink post it on my car . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
call me joyce _ _ _ _ _ _ _ |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i am happy she left the note and took responsibility for it , but what in the fuck is going on that every couple of months i 'm taking cars to the shop for things that are not my fault ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is the third incident in 15 months , and two of the three involved other folks hitting my parked cars !! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i knew my 20 year clean record would end sometime , but do the karma |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gods have to beat me over the head with a shovel about it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so today i had enterprise pick me up at 7:15 , which was great . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was worried about being late to work and , as it turned out , i was only 16 minutes late . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was given a choice between a taurus and an impala . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i made the wrong choice . |||O O O O O O 
so much for my gm loyalty . |||O O O O O O O 
they make great trucks and suv 's , but their sedans suck ass . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i will return this piece of shit on friday , only to rent another vehicle monday morning while we take the wife 's car to the shop to get her 1400 bucks worth of damage repaired . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i actually do n't know if it will be monday yet , as i didn ' twant to ruin joyce 's new year by giving her the bad news . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i plan to call her this morning and tell her the total , complete with my rental car for a week . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'll let you know how it goes . |||O O O O O O O O O 
goodwill towards all men , and keep away from my fucking vehicles !! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the college football season is finally over . |||O O O O O O O O 
on one hand , i am a bit sad because years like this only happen for auburn every 15 or 20 years , so it 's a little disappointing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the other hand , this worked out about as well as it could . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you asked me at the beginning of the year if i 'd rather be 8 - 3 and playing in the liberty bowl or 12 - 0 with a chance to win the sugar bowl , go 13 - 0 and finish second , i 'd say hell yeah to the latter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fact that pundits put ou ahead of auburn based on their out of conference schedule being tougher than ours is laughable now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the end , playing bowling green over us playing the citadel did n't make the sooners much better . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've seen softer takedowns on cops . |||O O O O O O O O 
usc came on to the field , gave up a td , then decided to make choke - lahoma their collective bitches , and they did just that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
38 - 10 at the half meant that i did n't even have to hear that dying hyena ashlee " no , i 'm the one with dark hair and no boobs " simpson butcher yet another song on tv. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hell , i read it on fark this morning . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
hooray for big first half beatings that get me an extra hour of sleep . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we might not have won , but we would n't have let leinert go long on us all night either . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
our db 's would have had something to say about that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , it turns out that when playing a decent team , ou ca n't do shit on offense . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that was just plain terrible . |||O O O O O O 
jason white looked like jason voorhees out there , stomping around getting caught from every direction any time he did n't hand of to peterson for a three yard loss . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in five years , oklahoma has played in four huge games , and lost three of them ... badly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that must feel like being a sox fan before this year , i 'd imagine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a year ago , tuberville was one reporter 's abililty to find an out of place airplane in ohio away from being fired before the alabama game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
then , the ad and president get canned , a booster starts down the long road to shun- ville , and tuberville keeps smiling and saying the right things . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he talks his two running backs and two stellar db 's into staying , then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron -clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years , and if auburn even thinks ... thinks about letting him go , they owe him every penny . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't even think there 's a morality clause . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
he could have sex with an endangered bald eagle , and they 'd still have to pay him . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and that 's the way it should be . |||O O O O O O O O O 
meanwhile , auburn fans can spend the next six months saying " yeah , but we 'd have done this " or " we were 13 - 0 , won the sec , beat five top ten teams , three of them on the road , and became the only undefeated sec team in the bcs 's history to not play for the title . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and coincidentally , oklahoma 's played in it this year , last year , and in 2000 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you won in 2000 , but you got punked the last two years , and last year you got to play for the title even though you did n't even win your conference . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you got embarassed by kansas state and lsu last year , and humiliated this year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the little 12 is sooo much better than the sec . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's why you played a four -loss team for your conference title this year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , considering the bcs is run by the head of the big 12 , it 's no wonder you get the benefit of the doubt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how about the fact that only two teams that did n't win their conference have ever played for the national title ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you and nebraska in 2001 . |||O O O O O O 
oh , the other thing you two big 12 teams have in common is that you got your asses kicked on the sport 's biggest stage . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so yes , we are disappointed . |||O O O O O O O 
but all you can do is play the schedule in front of you . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auburn did that with class and dignity , they won every game , faced down every challenge , and made every auburn fan in the country and the world proud . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , can someone get the auburn cheerleaders some of those usc sweaters ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mark backer 2005-01-05t16:32:00 much like the " i told you so 's " everyone is throwing at the uga basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of the harricks , folks around the buckeye state have to be having similar thoughts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it seems that ad and frequent " no we did n't " ohio state front man andy geiger is " retiring " after 11 years at the helm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
maybe it 's me , but i 'm guessing andy 's tired of putting on tv makeup and going on the news lying about what he or tressel knew about their athletes in general and their football program in particular . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it seems that maurice clarrett - gate just is n't going away . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
two years ago , everyone was saying " shame on you , maurice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you should have known better . " |||O O O O O O O 
now , it seems like most folks are saying " shame on you both andy and jim . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you both should have know better . " |||O O O O O O O O 
allegations have come to light that several osu players received illegal benefits including cash , access to cars , etc . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , i do n't expect the ad and coach to know everything , but when a player is driving a brand new car every couple of weeks or months , well , somebody ought to jot a memo and get to the bottom of that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it should n't surprise buckeye fans either , since tressel had similar problems at youngstown state , and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well , including ( surprise ) illegal benefits including cash , cars , grade fixing , etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
geiger is also tired from saying " we did n't do anything wrong " about his basketball program . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course , it was discovered that his men 's basketball coach had directly given six grand to a yugoslavian recruit , but that was just his stipend for travel and coach jim o'brien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates ... right andy ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i only hope that the ncaa will do something they rarely do : make a good sound decision and take away ohio state 's national title from january 2003 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it seems they had a very important and very ineligible player that season , and maybe many . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'd hate to give another title to thugtown miami , but i 'd give it to alabama before i 'd think it was okay for ohio state to keep . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if a tree fell in a cadadian forest ... |||O O O O O O O O O 
mark backer 2005-02-17t06:47:00 would it make a noise and if it did , would anyone south of boston give a shit ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gary bettman announced the cancellation of the 2004-2005 nhl season . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
as if everyone did n't already know that was the case . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
shame on the nhl and shame on the players ' association for not getting a deal done , but i put much more of the blame on the owners as this " negotiation " came down to the wire . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i understand that the league was losing less money by not playing than it would have by having a season this year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i also understand that when push came to shove , the players gave in and accepted a salary cap . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
okay , the sides were about 7 million per team apart , but could n't they just say " alright , let 's split that in half and play hockey ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean holy christ people , two kids arguing over 10 bucks would work it out that way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
why is this any different ? |||O O O O O O 
the nhl 's primary goal was to get a salary cap approved by the players , and they finally did . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and what did the nhl do when that momentus event occurred ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they left the negotiating table . |||O O O O O O 
gary bettman is a mindless troll and the professional sports commissioner equivalent of joe hazelwood and this lockout / strike / cluster fuck is the reef . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the first thing that needs to happen is that bettman and goodenow ( the players ' association rep ) need to be fired , deported , flogged , tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program , four dogs , four beers , and two cokes and parking to a game at an nhl arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
then , all current contracts need to be voided by the end of the season in 2006 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that means no team would own any player , and the owners would be free to sign whomever they 'd like using the " fiscal restraint " they all droned on and on about all year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that way , they 'd only pay as much as they could afford ... right ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those douchebags would end up overspending like every professional sports owner because they ca n't control themselves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if mr. iginla or heatley were free agents , for example , owners would bid each other out of their minds , then they 'd be left with not enough to get a competetive team . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while the business model in the nhl was certainly flawed and the owners needed help , they really needed help to protect them from themselves . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and the fact is that without that help , the owners would follow the same path that got them where they are right now anyway . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the biggest issue is this , however . |||O O O O O O O O 
very few people give one hot shit whether the nhl plays another game ever , let alone this season or the next one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for every crying canuck there are 1,000 or more others who say " no hockey ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and the last television network interested in carrying hockey ( espn ) may opt out of televising the nhl next season , meaning that all of the teams would be in huge trouble , because no tv = no league . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
atlanta lost the flames 25 years ago because , despite full houses every night , it 's tv revenue that pays the freight and the flames had no tv contract . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
imagine an entire league with no tv contract . |||O O O O O O O O O 
hell , major league soccer and the wnba do have a tv contract and no one gives a shit about them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'll say this for the nhl , when they screw up , they screw up huge . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you will forever be known as the generation that killed professional hockey in north america . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 'll look great on your resumes . |||O O O O O O O O

byrne 2004-12-09t 14:01:00 shares of martha stewart living omnimedia , a company whose name is so breathtakingly self - promoting it makes me long for the days when every single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called trump , continues to soar ; it rose $ 1.78 , or 7.29 % , on news that the company 's namesake will star in a new tv show once she , er ... gets out of prison . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
now , i know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks ( warner communications , which started as a merger between business in the three most mob-influenced industries around , comes to mind ) , but it 's a gamble and not a business strategy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the company 's performance was n't all that hot even before the ceo went to prison , and until very recently the stock price reflected that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but this is a one - person company , and at this point it 's saying the ' martha ' brand is worth some $ 1.31 billion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if anything , the value of the brand should decline over time , inasmuch as she 's rather , well , mortal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and she 's been convincted of obstruction of justice . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
this runup is based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and the embodiment of a much - resented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the federal government , they 'll be able to really coin some money . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

video rentals : the three hypotheses |||O O O O O O 
scrappy underdog netflix had it s day earlier in the year , when it became one of the hottest stocks around ( sporting an eye - popping p/e in the high 900's on the way up , and , thanks to a poor earnings report , over 1,000 on the way down ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's plenty of argument about the future of dvd and video rental , and netflix represents a pure - play on one of the three dominant hypotheses : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that business is o -v - e - r -- between pay - per-view , video - on - demand , pirated movies , high - bandwidth internet broadcasts , and the increasing availability of other media , it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals . |||O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI I-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those who do n't have the requisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films ; they 're the stodgy , expensive way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are n't any pure -play buys on this theory , but someone who believes it might overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any media stocks at all . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
of course , there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea , but psuedo.com failed without producing a single show , and broadcast.com was swallowed for $ 6 billion by yahoo! , to yahoo ! 's great regret . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not so fast -- it 'll just go online ! |||O O O O O O O O O O 
anyone who wants to counter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997 , when in terms of time used , text was the most popular kind of information online . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the time , and for years after , people argued that the traditional bookstore would become obsolete . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after all , how could we stand for a rapaciously arborcidal medium like ' books ' or ' newspapers ' when we could transmit the same data as bits and bytes and save on transportation , too ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as it turns out , of course , amazon.com , barnseandnoble.com , and a host of others simply took the bookstore model , attached a 56 k modem , and declared themselves |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
netflix is doing much the same thing : |||O O O O O O O O 
taking the traditional business online to cut costs and boost customer service . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
who d' you think you 're kidding ? |||O O O O O O O O 
you ca n't kill movie rental stores -- |||O O O O O O O O 
so there 's a big difference between movies and books : |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
for books , the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution ; if you do n't sell through them , books wo n't get sold . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for movies , the video rental store is just one way to get videos out there ( though at 45 - 55 % of studio revenues , it 's a much more important one than people think ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but given the high valuations ascribed to bricks - and - mortar - and - dead tree booksellers like barnes and noble , borders , and to a much lesser extent books -a - million , surely there 's room for a blockbuster , along with a movie gallery or two . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the latter , at least , still has room to grow . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
by focusing on smaller , rural communities ( preferably the sort that considers dsl ' newfangled ' ) they 're walmarting walmart -- competing with walmart 's awful in - store video rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for online distribution grows , but like every other business it leaves lots of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional ( read : high ) profits . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the aggressive bidding war for hollywood video , featuring two of their competitors , a buyout shop , and one of the savviest raiders around , is proof that some people still think these stores are worth something . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i 'm one of them . |||O O O O O O O 
for once , i 'm actually writing about something i own : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have shares of movie gallery , i 've suggested it to friends , and i 'd be quite thrilled if the stock went up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't do ' sell targets ' , but i 'd probably hold the stock if it ran up anything less than 50 % from this level . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if i sell , i 'll post a notification one trading day beforehand . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
because lord knows you care . |||O O O O O O 
byrne 2004-12-12t14:47:00 conglomerates are a fascinating species : |||O O O O O O O O 
the standard definition is 'a company involved in multiple unrelated businesses ' but the more accurate definition would be 'a company that relies on financial pyrotechnics , balance sheet juggling , and adroit accounting to create the illusion of growth ' . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i love to write about them , but i 'd hate to own one , since most of their market value comes from the market 's assumption that the company 's leaders will somehow find a way to retroactively justify their overvaluation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
usually , it does n't work , but when it does the results can be spectacularly entertaining . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they have many of the symptoms of a late - stage conglomerate : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a gigantic main business with slowing growth , fear that competition will substantially reduce the profitability of their main business , a shareholder base that includes many people who own only walmart stock ( thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification ) , and enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i can understand the concerns , but i do n't see the motivation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as a retailer of just about everything , walmart can expand into some pretty broadly - defined areas without going beyond either their core competencies or some arenas where they can cut costs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after all , adding some international shipping assets to their holdings would be a natural extension of their enormously successful practice of buying the distribution network for their products . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're coming close to smithfield food 's very successful ' squeal to meal ' policy ; if these rumors are true , the result for shareholders will be a pretty positive one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so oracle and peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one another in every imaginable way , are finally tying the knot ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O 
the final price , $ 26.50 per share , beats all the previous bids by a huge margin -- of course , oracle lowballed their earlier offers , and ended up basically bidding against themselves and the optimism of other peoplesoft shareholders for a year and a half . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's been a pretty grueling fight ( was it worth it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
how much of peoplesoft 's most valuable -- human -- resources will walk out the door the day their options vest ? ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
made all the more so by the widely - held assumption that larry ellison was either bluffing or screwing around . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't have oracle / peoplesoft 's spat to kick around anymore . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally unworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i wo n't dwell on the irony of an oracle employee being driven out of oracle , starting his own company , and forcing ellison to spend $ 10.3 billion to get his company -- but not him -- back ( though it does rather delightfully remind me of coca - cola basically giving away the bottling franchise and then spending billions to buy it back ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
ellison is brilliant enough to make this merger work , but he 's crazy enough to wreck even the soundest of deals . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
back in the day ( 2000-2003 or so ) some of the hottest non-homebuilding stocks were the gaming equipment manufacturers , who rode a wave of heavy reinvestment in casinos to produce huge profits . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now , all that reinvestment has paid off , and , along with a good dose of consolidation , made the industry moderately hot again . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
like every boom , whether merited or not , the big companies have big moves in the early stage , but it does n't get attention or turn into a mania until we see a frenetic ipo or two . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know where this is going : las vegas |||O O O O O O O O O 
sands kicked off it s first trading day with a 60 % gain after a last - minute increase in offering price to $ 29 a share , outside the $ 24 - $ 26 range bandied about after they dropped their first $ 20 - $ 22 estimate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but , well , the business is complicated and the business is tough . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wynn resorts , another owner of the lucrative macau license that captured investors 's attention during the ipo , illustrates this well enough : steve wynn , the company 's founder , made a gigantic fortune when he bet his company 's future on atlantic city . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when investors saw his $ 160 million all - debt investment turn into a $ 440 million asset in just a few years -- his net worth took a similar , though even less gravitationally - bound arc , rising from $ 2 million to $ 75 million durign the same time ) they all rushed in . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
needless to say , wynn sold when everyone else bought , and he made it through the cannibalizing near - collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
so , applause and cheers all around to the casinos raising such spectacular sums for your broad - scoped ambitions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and a premature apology to the newly - minted shareholders , who will doubtless see some eye - popping returns in the right direction for a little while and then face a long road back to the reality that is a price around half the current one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
full disclosure , just for the hell of it : |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i was bearish about the google ipo , too . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
gazprom , the main russian gas company , has been denied a $ 10 billion credit line due to the political situation in russia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for yukos assets ( hence that firm 's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know it 's bad when you have to use us courts to protect your own assets from appropriation by your home country ) . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's starting to look like putin 's goal is a sort of judicial nationalization -- taking control of key assets through court , rather than executive , fiat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the markets have caught on , and russia may be deprived of the capital it needs to grow . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do n't expect any of the russian leadership to reverse course ; given the current trends there , they 'll just blame the west when their screwy plan screws them over . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so far , the yukos auction has produced more questions than answers , and so far the biggest of the former is just who made off with their prize assets . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
auctioneers reported a $ 9.3 billion winning bid for yuganskneftgaz -- the company 's main asset , worth two to three times that amount -- by an anonymous company located in tver . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it turns out the anonymous company , baikalfinansgroup , shares an address with ooo tverneftemash , which was recently bought by zao gazpromgeocomservice , not to ever be confused by the similarly - named gazprom ( which by the way has a similar logo ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gazprom , of course , is the gigantic , kremlin -supported gas company most observers assumed would bid for the assets . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are n't many groups in russia who can afford a $ 9.3 billion bet , particularly when it 's such a politically - weighted one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gazprom may have arranged some last - minute debt financing , or might have an outside partner , but i seriously doubt they were n't in some way involved with the company that won the auction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
everlast 's rally just might live up to the name |||O O O O O O O O O O 
everlast , mainly a maker of boxing equipment , has soared over the last several days thanks to a licensing deal with jacques moret allowing moret to buy out their women 's apparel license for $ 30 million , on top of a $ 12.5 million payment now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in other words , a competitor has decided that one segment of the company 's business is potentially worth $ 42.5 million . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
investors have prudently valued the remaining business -- the extremely well - known everlast brand , the possible new reality tv show , and most of the company 's assets -- at a negative $ 16.5 million . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the company 's stock would have to rise more than 50 % from the current level to put a zero value on that business . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at least we have consensus |||O O O O O 
well , we do n't , but we 've something very much like it : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a company hitting and then rehitting lows that would have been unthinkable even after their pull - back a year ago , accusations and proof of some less - than - kosher accounting , and , best of all , allegations of egregious self - dealing by insiders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a glance at the analyst opinions shows that they have a lone bull cheerleading the stock , and plenty of bears hammering it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's evidence enough that it 's underpriced ; the market usually reacts to a downgrade by dropping the stock a percent or two , but i ca n't help it -- i presume most of these downgrades arose from the classic " well , what does your analyst think ? " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" he says it 's a buy , " " well , what 's it done this year ? " conversation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nobody wants to be caught recommending a loser , and unlike portfolio managers with a net asset value report card every trading day , analysts can essentially start fresh with each new opinion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the best analysts get noted , lauded , and showered with cash . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , they 're still averaged in with the rest . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and anyway , i do n't consider analysts anything but aggregators of publically - available information and echo-chambers for previously - determined opinions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they ca n't really add much without straying into the realm of inside information , and what they do add is usually factored in the moment the report is released . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
or , in an ideal world , it should be . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
thankfully , ours is a less - than - ideal , though by no means dystopic , market , so we get plenty of opportunities to profit from the mistakes of others . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as long as the bearish opinions of analysts weighs down on krispy kreme , i 'll be a bull . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not an ordinary earnings miss ? |||O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-01-20t16:41:00 ebay 's nauseating $ 19.72 decline ( a loss of 19.14 % ) has that end - of - an - era feel , like the motorola crash described in the money game or the nadir of the dot.com collapse profiled in dot.con . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's news , of course ( the only time there 's no news whatsoever is when the entire market tanks ) , but missing estimates by a penny and showing some ' red flags ' should n't be an excuse for lopping off twice as much as the market had the night before ( after hours , ebay had lost a modest 10 % or so ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
watching a stock drop after hours , open lower , and close even lower than that makes me wonder just who 's selling : a runup usually builds on a gradual crescendo of greater - fool theory -- everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber -- and ends when the greatest fool yet gets sick of the whole thing and bails . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , it 's owned heavily by everyone . |||O O O O O O O O O 
so the only thing folks can do is sell . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-01-26t07:11:00 merck posted a 21 % decline in earnings thanks to the new post-vioxx announcement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most of the profit decline was because vioxx , representing about 11 % of sales , now represents a pretty severe legal headache : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not only have they lost the revenue , but they 've taken a $ 600 million charge as a reserve against future vioxx losses . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if that 's an accurate number , investors should cheer up : merck 's at fifteen times annualized earnings , twelve times forward earnings , and underappreciated by most of wall street . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i bought the day of the vioxx announcement . |||O O O O O O O O O 
and if i want to stay that contrarian , i 'll have to sell only when i get an inside tip that they 've cured cancer , aids , heart disease , and death . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you read the quarterly more carefully , you 'll notice that the charge is not related to liabilities from vioxx but merely costs associated with legal defense , i.e. , just the cost of paying the lawyers in all of these cases . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if that s how much they 're willing to pay for legal defense , imagine how much the actual liabilities are gon na be . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
good blog , i found you via your instalanche . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
usually , i do n't read the filings as carefully as i should -- i leave it up to alert readers , i guess . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyway , i still think the vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefits for years , get sued , and 1 ) keep the product on the shelves , 2 ) remain in business , and 3 ) do 2 ) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits , we merckers might be safe . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we could always ignore them , right ? |||O O O O O O O O 
one of the rules of thumb that has guided my ( limited ) business career from the beginning is that china is never as lucrative as it looks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this assumption is based on about 150 years of economic history , including several booms in interest and investment in china . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's usually a 200 - to - 1 ratio of nearly starving peasant laborers to absurdly well - off government employees . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now it 's an iffier 100 - to - 1 , since there are also rich private sector employees and the labor force is n't quite so expendable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what they 've been missing for years was the real driver behind any consumer economy : consumers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
specifically , they did n't have a real middle class . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's changed in the last twenty years , as increasing social mobility and a burst in foreign demand has finally made china a genuine , rather than theoretical , contender . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and they 've even supplied proof of their economic viability , announcing that they 've beaten japan for exports to the us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if only i 'd figured this out in early 2002 , when their stock market was by some stretch of the imagination cheap . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i dunno if you want anything to do with their stock market . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for one , it s perforance last year was pretty dismal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
more importantly , it s a structural nuthouse . |||O O O O O O O O O 
unfortunately , minority shareholder rights are virtually non-existent , and excluding the dodgy financial statements listed on the exchange , lots of times companies are more interested in generating cash from an ipo then actually bothering with shareholder value . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1447832 finally , the shanghai composite on july , 1997 was trading at 1189.76 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as of january 27 , 2005 it 's sitting at 1225.89 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O

byrne 2005-02-01t07:48:00 georgia 's insurance commissioner , john oxendine , claims that marsh ' got off the hook ' -- and you can bet he 's got a plan to fix that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
perhaps the worst feature of spitzer 's attila the hun - like sweep through the financial services industry is his habit of breeding imitators , who will essentially use his settlement as a benchmark for creating their own demands . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
interestingly enough , this morning 's wall street journal reported that marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to -- that the $ 850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so marsh could pay out over a four - year period without admitting guilt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the rhetoric we 're hearing -- that marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars -- does n't match the reality that in a few cases , they manipulated bids , but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5 % or 10 % higher than it otherwise would have been . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i own shares of marsh , and i would not be particularly dissapointed if eliot spitzer 's career took a sudden nosedive thanks to , say , questions about his business relationship to money manager and alleged stock manipulator jim cramer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nothing personal ; i just think he 's the fifth horseman of the fiscal apocalypse , representing irresponsible investing with wild abandon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's always difficult to get used to a central fact of the modern economy : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the best new technology will keep getting better at an absolutely astounding rate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
usually , the improvement curve flattens pretty fast -- the usual auto industry / computer industry comparison works just fine ( according to the standard urban legend , bill gates notes that " if we 'd been making cars instead of software , you 'd get 500 miles to the gallon , need an oil change every 250,000 miles , and be able to replace your car for $ 200 , " to which a mythical gm executive replies " ah , but if microsoft made cars , they 'd crash three times a day , too ! " ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyway , a few announcements during the last two days underscore the fact that the growth in memory and processing power for computers is far from over : hewlett - packard is developing a new replacement for the transistor , and a consortium of software companies is backing a new technology that would allow discs to hold up to a terabyte of information . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no idea where this will end up : |||O O O O O O O O 
it 's not altogether rare that these announcements result in a very expensive project to develop something that , for whatever reason , is n't worthwhile to consumers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but it 's important to remember that the status quo is never more than a snapshot -- investing as though it 's permanent is a recipe for disaster . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
according to the usually reliable cnn / money , the " twin deficits " will continue to grow . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i believe they 're referring to the budget deficit and ... the capital surplus ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
when analyzing trade deficits , it 's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the us . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from us consumers ( who control about 20 % of global gdp ) and everybody else ( excluding the non-consumption share of us gdp , that would amount to around 75 % of global gdp ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods , the largest pressure on the deficit is that we 're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and what about that other deficit ? |||O O O O O O O 
it , of course , is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes , but by borrowing funds . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in asia . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , not to be a heretic , but 1 ) we 're issuing them at relatively low interest rates , 2 ) inflation is bound to pick up eventually , and so 3 ) would n't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non -us investors , rather than raising taxes in america ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a question of who will pay for the same spending , and all else being equal i 'd be happy for asian central banks to pick up the tab . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the twin deficits are a reality , but they are n't exactly a terrifying one . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the market did n't have an intelligent way to react to this news ( except to send nasdaq , which i 've been cheerleading for a while , up 10.46 % in sympathy ) , but the new york stock exchange may actually convert to a for - profit entity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's far too clubby now , and while this move would n't get rid of nine - figure paydays , it might ensure that they only happen when well - deserved . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not to name names or anything . |||O O O O O O O 
the exchange needs this : it 's ossified , the real owners -- holders of exchange seats -- have seen their investment lose 40 % in a year ( though they can still earn an income from it to offset the losses ) , and the nasdaq has undercut their traditional dominance among growth companies - turned - blue chips . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
heck , they 're down to just over half of their single - letter symbols ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a dying organization , and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
full disclosure : " far more efficient companies , " basically means " the nasdaq , " so take it with a gigantic grain of salt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you can take the above at face value ; i do n't own stock in a salt company . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
everything comes with lots of grains of salt . |||O O O O O O O O O 
ever read the label on a soup can ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
it 's amazing they can squeeze any liquid in there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
and if you crumble up crackers in there , that 's even more salt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , i 'm not sure how i take the nyse news . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think i agree with you on the wreckless compensation thing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i also think that sears - kmart should come up with a new name altogether . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those stores are deadzones , and they need some buzz . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
change the names , paint the buildings , reorganize a little , and hire strippers for cashiers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not sure how that last idea got in there . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i really miss the days when a major international oil company could basically buy some tiny , ill -established foreign government to get at its natural resources . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've progressed a bit since then : |||O O O O O O O O 
now , the third world countries all have their own state oil companies , who are picking apart the carcasses of once -private concerns . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the capital spectator reports on the latest : not only china , but india 's state oil company has decided to get into the yukos - dismemberment trade . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
at first , i was pretty skeptical of gmail -- an announcement of something new , cool , and free , from a quirky company , on april fool 's day ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
turns out my initial attitude was n't justified , of course , and gmail has been a popular success . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just this weekend , google gave many users another fifty invitations , prompting some to speculate that it could be the start of gmail 's final move out of beta . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
their marketing was absolutely brilliant : |||O O O O O O 
simply through association with google , and because of the invitation - only membership , they created a product with instant cachet -- something so in demand invitations went for $ 50 on ebay , and one enterprising site even offered a kidney for an invite . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
everyone who wants a gmail account has one , and yet people with invites have an almost pathological desire to give them away . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's been nearly a year , the service is nearly ubiquitous , and somehow google has kept us obsessed with gmail . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

byrne 2005-02-06t20:09:00 frenetic merger and acquisition activity does n't mean much in the early days of a business -- it 's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward - thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but when an outsider buys into the business once it 's established itself as important , but before it 's really gotten profitable , it 's big news . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
for now , it 's just a rumor that ask jeeves is buying bloglines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'd keep an eye on this -- if ask jeeves pops on the news , the easy money from the blogging trend is already gone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

yukos update : all previous yukos updates wrong |||O O O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-02-07t07:46:00 apparently yuganskneftegaz , which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state ( yes , the same state that 1 ) forced yukos to do the auction , and 2 ) ran the auction , not that 3 ) this is suspicious or anything ) , and which was then being bought with foreign assistance , is not being bought with foreign assistance . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

byrne 2005-02-08t20:33:00 today 's performance said a lot about how the market viewed certain subjects ; tomorrow 's will tell us even more . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
today , ask jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring bloglines . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
and tonight , cisco reported solid earnings and weak sales . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the market 's modestly pessimistic reaction to the bloglines news tells us that blogging is n't seen as a major profit source yet ; tomorrow 's trading will tell us whether the market is ready to accept that more established technology businesses are back on track as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after hours , cisco 's been slammed , but once they 're exposed to the rest of the trading population , the results might differ . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do n't think bloglines will ever be a major source of profits or revenues . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blogging itself could become a pretty big consumer past time like watching tv , reading a book , or playing video games but i am not sure how bloglines really benefits . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i would guess it most benefits the search engines , hit counters , and software builders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with the explosion in available market commentary that happened through the internet it is not clear to me that by lowering the costs of access blogging really adds that much as much as it did to political commentary . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
maybe seeking alpha can become the new tscm but i do n't think that will change the landscape as much as howard dean 's campaign did . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-02-08t20:59:00 stephen of ira - cam is experiencing sitemeter envy over all those succesful political blogs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after all , my biggest surge in hits came from a link from , well , a political blog . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , i 'd rather not worry -- instead , i 'd like to think of our situation as akin to instapundit , or andrew sullivan , or daily kos in , say , the summer of 2001 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blogs did n't get huge until people saw them updated continuously on september 11th , and during the primaries , and later on during the conventions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in politics , there 's a definite four - year cycle , and any new medium can find it s voice and carve out an audience in that time . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
financial markets are n't so kind . |||O O O O O O O 
in short , we need a crash , and we need to blog it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that sounds downright sinister . |||O O O O O 
those poliblog hits come at a cost . |||O O O O O O O O 
my half - hearted trolling dragged back some hate to my site . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
no wonder why they turn off the comments . |||O O O O O O O O O 
when you 're blogging about stocks , it 's possible -- though a little difficult -- to say " okay , you 're right , i 'm wrong . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i 'm going to sell what i had , and sell it short ! " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and everyone can be reasonably happy . |||O O O O O O O 
but a political blog is usually built around a certain ideology , and no matter how compelling you are , you probably wo n't change anyone 's stated opinions ( instant counterpoint : check little green footballs now , and compare that to the september 11th archive ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sirius satellite -- brilliant plan , or grasping at straws ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-02-09t19:23:00 mel karmazin is pushing to add sirius satellite services to ipods -- an interesting idea , inasmuch as it seems to defeat the purpose of both . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the ipod 's the tiniest possible container for vast music libraries , and sirius is a way to get at lots of content when said music library is unavailable . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the other hand , karmazin and jobs are two of the smartest dealmakers around , so they might find a way to structure this or spin it to the benefit of everyone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
my main suspicion is that this is karmazin hoping to see the phrase " mel karmazin , ceo [ " that 's right , " mel says to himself , " c- e- friggin - o ! " ] of sirius satellite radio ... " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
steve jobs knows a bad idea when he 's pitched it , for exactly the reasons you point out . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
plus , a satellite receiver burns a lot of power , even if it could be made tiny . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the other hand , the guy has convinced some very smart people to spend huge sums on stupid ideas -- there is n't much talk about it now , but back when his reputation was n't so hot ( late ' 80s ) , lots of journalists talked about the " steve jobs reality distortion field . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he could get people to ignore every single technical obstacle to an idea , and invest on the basis of something beautifully , but ridiculously , simple . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
basically , he sells the future ; the i pod and the mac mini are just times he got lucky and the future caught up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

out come the long knives |||O O O O O 
carly made a lot of journalistic enemies during her six hears at hp . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not only was the catalyst for her fall from grace a fortune article by carol loomis ( who as far as i know is immortal -- she 's been writing for fortune since 1954 ) , but the anti -carly brigades are out in full force at salon.com . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is getting a little harsh ; she might have messed up at hp ( i refuse to call it by the new name , for now ) , but she was n't actively trying to destroy a great company and wreck the shareholders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so , right , carly was a bad manager , and she eventually got what she deserved , but she is n't evil incarnate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've been keeping a careful eye on the blockbuster / hollywood machinations for a while ( and well i should -- i have stock in one of the deal 's participants , movie gallery ) , but even so i 'm surprised that blockbuster 's latest gambit is to buy up hollywood 's debt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's an admirable hedge -- if movie gallery wins , it could improve hollywood 's rating , and either way it offers blockbuster some leverage . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and this is , as far as i know , the first time since the allegheny deal that there 's been a hostile takeover using debt . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
joe granville 's still at it |||O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-02-12t17:17:00 joseph granville , the octogenarian technical analyst , has predicted a precipitous decline in stock prices this year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm a little bearish , myself ( it always helps ) , but i 've taken the liberty of checking some alternate sources for granville information , from which i get the following incident : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
granville 's behavior easily attracted public attention . |||O O O O O O O O 
his investment seminars were bizarre extravaganzas , sometimes featuring a trained chimpanzee who could play granville 's theme song , " the bagholder 's blues , " on a piano . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he once showed up at an investment seminar dressed as moses , wearing a crown and carrying tablets . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
granville made extravagant claims for his forecasting ability . |||O O O O O O O O O 
he said he could forecast earthquakes and once claimed to have predicted six of the past seven major world quakes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he was quoted by time magazine as saying , " i do n't think that i will ever make a serious mistake in the stock market for the rest of my life , " and he predicted that he would win the nobel prize in economics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sounds like a paragon of stability and common sense to me ! |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was hoping for another incredibly drawn - out story , full of antitrust drama , lurking potential bidders , and contentious confrontations between executives . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and then mci just sort of accepted a verizon deal without really bothering anybody . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
clearly , their corporate culture has suffered -- 25 years ago , mci was the brawling upstart in the telecom industry , constantly challenging at&t 's right to exist , much less to monopolize the phone system . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now , they 're swallowed by just another monolith . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i expected better -- meaner and tougher , sure , but better nonetheless . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
g 's investing -- greenspan and star wars |||O O O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-02-15t18:58:00 g 's investing argues that alan greenspan is a george lucas-esque figure : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the star wars universe of george lucas , he portrays a benevolent dictatorship ( or benevolent monarchy ) as being superior to a democracy , with the democracy being the system rife with bureaucracy and bloat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with greenspan 's unspoken position as economic czar , that 's what we have right now : a benevolent dictatorship of the fed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but one of the why dictatorships are so inferior to democracies is that democracy offers a stable , peaceful transfer of power . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
will we have that at the fed , when greenspan leaves |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI 
ca n't remember where i saw this , maybe at socialsecuritychoice.org . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
anyways , the battle lines for social security privatization are being identified as those who are for choice and ownership ( bush ) , versus those who equate investing in the sp 500 as playing the slot machines ( aarp , most democrats , etc ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the battle is now for the endorsement of sir alan greenspan . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
where will dr. greenshades come down in this debate ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
what will he say on privatization and the associated costs with implementing such a system ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that 'll have a pretty big impact on what happens next ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i ca n't tell you how much i want to take sides here , but i 'm trying to keep my political opinions out of this -- i 'd really hate to alienate half my political audience in a single endorsement . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i 'll just note that i do n't see it as quite so black - and - white , and i think some of the compromises ( like reducing taxes for parents , on the grounds that children are the assets backing social security ) might be useful and -- we are dealing with a win - or - lose , vote - or - not situation -- practical . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yeah , i 'm interested in hearing some obtuse greenspanisms regarding this topic ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-02-16t21:20:00 northshore management , the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds , is now facing actual sec action . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the amount in question : $ 37 million . |||O O O O O O O O O 
while it 's not a major sum compared to the amounts consider before ( as high as $ 90 million ) , it 's good to see that the issue 's getting resolved . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
though , of course , there 's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted , not actually criminal ; apparently , the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they 're guilty of front - running , at the least . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but they might have been using northshore as an alternative source of capital : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
having invested all they could risk , it would only make sense to turn to other sources . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what we 'll need to look for in the coming weeks are 1 ) what happened to the money once it was invested in these companies ( were they real companies , or just avenues for stolen funds ? ) |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and 2 ) how much of this was disclosed beforehand . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
an airline passenger 's bill of rights ? |||O O O O O O O O 
has the eu once again lost its mind ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
the one industry in which europe incontrovertibly beats the us is their aviation industry , thanks mainly to the fact that their lawmakers have left the operation of the industry up to the people who own it , and left passenger 's rights in the hands of choosy passengers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and now they 're ready to ' fix ' that with a new package of ill - advised rules completely changing the nature of airlines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
before , a potential customer could choose between a cosy , near - certain ride from an expensive company or a hustled , uncomfortable , and absurdly cheap one from a smaller competitor . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
pure potential , or , potentially , nothing |||O O O O O O O O 
read this report on the u.s. - russia technology symposium . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's a great summary of the paradoxes of the russian economy : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they have a huge untapped supply of valuable it labor , but their it exports are only a tenth of their military exports ( and only a thirtieth of india 's it exports ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they develop lots of new technology , but nobody can tell who owns what . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and , of course , their securities laws and property rights are even flimsier than china 's -- after the putin administration mugged yukos on the grounds that it was too attractive a target to leave alone , they lost a lot of trust . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
still , they have an unbelieveable amount of untapped potential . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
byrne 2005-02-22t19:19:00 i can think of only one good reason to be this enthusiastic about martha stewart living : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the fact that so many investors are so clearly enthusiastic about martha stewart living . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there are few worse times to buy a stock than when the namesake and guiding force behind the company is in prison ( whether or not she really should be ) , advertising is down by nearly half , and the brand has been tarnished beyond recognition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and yet the stock 's within a few points of an all - time high . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the other hand , the russian legal system is a bit less , well , legalistic -- they seem much more concerned about the chance that someone will harm the state than about actual matters of right and wrong . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so it 's pretty significant that mikhail khodorkovsky is taking the risk of maintaining his innocence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at this point , he has essentially no chance of recovering anything , unless russia sees a change in political control and the us applies some pressure . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we all know by now that choicepoint allowed some highly respectable nigerian businessmen of impeccable credentials to view hundreds of thousands of customer records for entirely legitimate purposes -- they were paying customers , after all , and the customer is always right . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but even after that huge mistake -- or rather , because of it -- the company 's top executives began dumping shares like mad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what 's scary is that since they started selling , the stock 's down about 5 % . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
clearly , they were expecting lots more damage . |||O O O O O O O O O 
these insider sales were certainly stupid , and probably criminal ( though the legal proof may be hard to come by ) but the solution is easy enough : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they need to buy stock from the company itself , at some premium to the prices at which they sold -- they 'll have the same stake as before , the shareholders would have gotten their money back ( since the premium goes to the company , which is owned by the shareholders ) , and there 's no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
or , if you want to do things the sec 's way , you could 1 ) hire a bunch of lawyers with the company 's ( shareholders ' ) money , 2 ) hire a legion of pr firms to explain away that frivolous spending , 3 ) hire a new accountant to magically turn that spending into an investment amortizable over twenty years , and 4 ) settle out - of - court by having the execs give the sec some pittance ( for which they 'll likely be compensated by the company ) and a statement that " we neither admit nor deny that we did what you claim , but we 'll never do it again . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thank god for the sec -- they 've practically made it a shareholder 's utopia , here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
southern states considering higher cigarette taxes ? |||O O O O O O O 
good plan ; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states , inasmuch as the states are caretakers for plenty of people who are ill thanks to cigarettes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what 's notable in this debate , however , is that according to msn moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that " while north carolina 's excise tax is only 5 cents , the total taxes given to north carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
okay , okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states , that 's technically accurate . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society , and inasmuch as these penalties are n't assessed on a per-pack basis , they do n't -- they 're a lump - sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
interestingly , the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatable synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unless they pay full cost . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're basically buying future medical care throughout their lives , rather than eventually making the ( healthy ) remainder of the populace pay up . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you 'd think he was busy enough with blockbuster and hollywood , but carl icahn is once again going after mylan labs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'd love to call it a classic raid -- he 's making an offer for the company , nominating his own board , claiming management can accept one or the other or both , and hinting that if they paid him enough , he 'd probably go away . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
but the whole point of raiding is to outsmart an opponent , and that means the strategy changes constantly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in this case , the most interesting twist is that he 's shorting shares of mylan 's acquisition target , king pharmaceuticals ; he 's basically doubling down on the bet that they wo n't acquire . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
not only that , but if mylan bought him out , they 'd have less money to fund a purchase of king pharmaceuticals . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
either way , he 's showing a lot of confidence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
given his record , it 's warranted . |||O O O O O O O O 
who will lead the revolution ? |||O O O O O O 
for my holiday post , i offer a message of hope for the business world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in 1994 , i was a graduate student in boston . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at harvard business school . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
the conference was being held by a new group called students for responsible business . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i expected to see a small gathering of idealistic , slightly naive mba students . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what i found was a packed room of 200 intelligent , practical , driven idealists . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
students for responsible business is now called net impact . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
in 2004 , i had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by the university of texas mccombs business school . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
net impact had grown to include over 9,000 mba students and alumni . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O 
the buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship , sustainable profitability , working with passion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
these students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
recently business schools have received their share of criticism for turning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of their responsibility for ethical action . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i can tell you that i am seeing a powerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is not coming from the faculty , or the alumni , or the administration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
all these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the change is being demanded by the students . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a little secret of business schools is that mba students have an immense amount of sway . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
few choose to use it , but if they want they can fundamentally change their school . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
right now students at business schools are asking for more discussion of these topics in classes , are initiating service projects , forming support group for social entrepreneurs , inviting speakers to campus to discuss sustainability , social investing , non-profit innovations , etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
net impact is often at the center of these efforts . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
these are not isolated events ... |||O O O O O O 
this is a revolution from within . |||O O O O O O O 
i have no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact that these students are having in the world of business and society at large . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in 1776 adam smith spoke of enlightened self - interest in the wealth of nations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i often feel that we have conveniently forgotten his emphasis on enlightened which he defined as being committed to being a good citizen and steward of society . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i am excited and hopeful that this new generation of business leaders will bring this emphasis front and center . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you are an mba student and want a good reference for comparing how mba programs integrate issues of sustainability and social responsibility into the student experience a good place to start is the beyond grey pinstripes report produced by the aspen institute . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's good to be the king ! |||O O O O O O O O 
here 's an entertaining little morsel from business week online ( no byline given ) : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but on the subject of succession , those two look like role models compared with insurance giant american international group inc. ( aig ) , whose aging ceo has no plans to retire . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
greenberg , who turns 80 in may , groomed two sons to be successors , but both have since left aig.greenberg sr. then created an office of the chairman in 2002 , which includes co -coos martin j. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
sullivan and donald p. kanak . |||O O O O O O 
both are considered possible successors , but the board wo n't know greenberg 's preference until his departure , when it opens a sealed letter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
perhaps this is a good time for a quick refresher .... |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
the ceo works for the board ...end lesson . |||O O O O O O O O O 
i guess it is not as straight forward when your ceo is also chairman and one of the largest shareholders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it would be tempting to get on my high horse right now about the need to separate the positions of ceo and chairman but to be honest with you i do n't really believe that . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i know ceo / chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
having a combined ceo / chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this downside of having a combined ceo / chair is offset by ( 1 ) a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and ( 2 ) an increase in the negotiating position of the ceo when dealing with suppliers , potential merger partners , etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
# 2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do however look more carefully at the top management team of a company with a ceo / chair before investing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is important that you can get a sense of the trustworthiness of the ceo . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is there high turnover among senior managers ? |||O O O B-TRI O O O O 
is there a record of regulatory problems ? |||O O O O O O O O 
if the ceo is new , i also look at the performance of the ceo 's previous company . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
i am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the ceo left . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
how to find securities class action lawsuits |||O O O O O O O 
john a 2005-01-05t 09:22:00 yesterday 's bad day for krispy kreme included some speculation that the new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be granted class action status . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
if you are interested in getting information about securities class actions for a company , you should check out the stanford law school 's securities class action clearinghouse . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this site has a very easy to use search function and it might be worth the time to run a quick check on companies of interest to you as possible investments . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
researchers affiliated with the clearinghouse just released an interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the results highlight trends in types of filings ( increase in product market related filings ) , affected sectors ( big increase in energy & technology sector ) , and overall number of filings ( fairly steady ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
get the full report here or the press release here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
shareholders benefit from employer reputation |||O O O O O 
it is just about time for fortune magazine to release its 2005 list of 100 best companies to work for . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so now is a good time to ask a simple question : |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
making this list is certainly a source of pride . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
it can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
should anyone else pay attention to this list ? |||O O O O O O O O O 
well , thanks for asking because i just happen to have an answer for that question . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it turns out that investors can benefit by paying attention to this list as well . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in a study published in the journal of business finance & accounting ( 2003 , 30:771-798 ) , greg filbeck and dianna preece found that companies on the fortune list of 100 best companies to work for outperformed a matched sample of firms along multiple measures of return . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this study is particularly relevant for investors because the authors measured return after the list was announced . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to often these studies use as a starting point the moment before information becomes public . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the only way to benefit from such information is by holding the stock before the information becomes public . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this study indicates that the best companies to work for information may still be useful even after the information becomes public . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it might also be useful to look at companies that have consistently made the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess about their inclusion on this year 's list . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
search the news archives and see if in the past year the company did anything that might have totally pissed off their employees . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
massive layoffs , bitter union battles , stopped offering free massages , etc . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you might also want to be wary if the ceo or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that can often generate a period of uncertainty in a workforce . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it 's hard to complain about cheap airfares but .. |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i ca n't for the life of me figure out why anyone would invest in the airline industry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
please , someone tell me a group companies facing more serious problems than the legacy airline carriers ( delta , us airways , continental , american , northwestern , united ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
high fuel costs , insane pension obligations , and a highly paid , specialized workforce . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
to this list of woes , we add a whole slew of competitors with much lower cost structures . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i admit i 've already taken advantage of the lower fares announced last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going to be pretty for some of these companies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
unfortunately , the pain is not limited to these companies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
pittsburgh , one of us airway 's hubs , built up its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
now us airways has reduced flights out of pittsburgh by 28 % since january of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
these shiny new airports are usually financed by long - term bonds that still have to paid off ... but not by the airlines . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is an industry looking for a sustainable strategy . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
southwest and jetblue were the only major airlines to earn a profit in 2004 but who knows what will be happening in another five years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so i will thankfully accept the low fares , bemoan the loss of food on flights , and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
businessweek online has some other commentary about the fare cuts here and about us airway 's woes here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john a 2005-01-10t 10:09:00 remember how you stress every year to get those #% ^^$%# tax forms filed on time ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
just imagine how nortel feels . |||O O O O O O 
early on tuesday nortel will be filing its 2003 financial statements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it also expects to restate 2001 and 2002 earnings . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
none of this is really new information . |||O O O O O O O O 
so the worst is behind them right ? |||O O O O O O O O 
late filing of audited financial statements and earning restatements both factor into my external reporting organizational indicator . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as a rule , i am wary of companies that do either of these things until i am confident that they have changed their standard business practices . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it may take a couple years , and several more financial filings ( on time of course ) , before i am persuaded to take a second look at the company . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the bottom line is that i rely on sec filings to assess companies and i do n't want to have any doubt about the veracity of the information contained in these documents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in nortel 's defense , they have just gone through the perfect storm in the telecommunications equipment sector . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the whole industry overbuilt and got blindsided by the tech downturn . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this could be described as a growth industry that went on a bender and is now trying to recover from the hangover . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 've always felt that you learn a lot about someone when you see how they try to recover from a hangover ( pause for brief college flashback ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a great time to assess organizational effectiveness in the telecommunications equipment industry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nortel and lucent attempted to hide the damage |||O O O O O O O O 
i 'm not drunk ! ) and hope for an uptick in demand before they would have to come clean . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
both companies have been penalized for these actions and have continued to restructure operations , sell assets , and layoff employees . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
cisco , on the other hand , was able to take one huge restructuring charge in 2001 and move forward . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
their ability to do this and have it work ( so far ) indicates a very deep and impressive understanding of their organization . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
especially when compared to its competitors , cisco seems to be back in fighting form due to it 's ability to rapidly assess its organizational structure and reconfigure to meet the changing market . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not bad for a company with a hangover ! |||O O O O O O O O O 
the 2005 business blogging awards are now open for voting . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a great place to find a number of interesting sites . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i found a number of blogs that i enjoy among the nominations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i expect i 'll be adding to my blogroll from this list . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
little ole monty 's bluff is in the running for best new business blog . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'm glad to be in such good company . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
so take a few seconds , head on over and cast your vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
beyond hippies and tree huggers |||O O O O O 
just saying these words seems to elicit some fairly simplistic knee - jerk reactions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the reaction that i find most amusing is the knowing look of sympathy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , the one that says " poor naive soul . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if only you understood economics , you would understand the folly of your ways . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i do not intend to get into the stakeholder vs stockholder debate here or argue the relative merits of atlas shrugged . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those discussions , though interesting , avoid a simpler question . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
do measures of corporate social responsibility contain valuable added information that help investors pick winning investments ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if all that you have read about this topic is an article in business week or the wall street journal , you 've probably heard the standard answer -- the evidence is mixed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that is true but not very revealing would n't you say ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
evidence is mixed mostly because ( 1 ) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and ( 2 ) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lumped together . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
social responsibility often includes everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yet both get lumped together in the socially responsible investing discussion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various components , you start to see the valuable information . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
companies that have poor employee relations tend to underperform , as do companies that pollute at a higher rate than their industry peers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the other hand , companies with numerous nlrb violations do n't do worse than their peers and companies that sell your typical " sin " products ( tobacco , firearms , gambling ) can be excellent investments . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
lump all these things together and of course you will get mixed results . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
taken separately , they provide valuable information about future firm performance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i guess it is time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalist vs. hippie tree hugger in this discussion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
though that would make a great celebrity death match episode . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
here are abstracts from 16 significant studies about socially responsible investing and an interesting essay on the subject . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

as far as i could tell , many people in the northwest spend the mornings drinking lattes and their evenings drinking microbrews . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
really not a bad lifestyle . |||O O O O O O 
anyway , back on topic here . |||O O O O O O O 
both companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on optimistic expectations of future growth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yesterday 's news led many to question their growth assumptions for these companies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
today i want to talk a bit about starbucks . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i think i have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this may partially justify a higher p/e ratio . |||O O O O O O O O O 
a couple weeks ago , i observed that wal - mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
starbucks , on the other hand , has uniformly strong organizational indicators . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
not surprising are its strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it s weakest score is in the external reporting indicator . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the past , several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the weak score is primarily the result of starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a strategic shift that has short - term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
beyond the strong organizational indicator analysis , several additional factors favor starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
1 . starbucks has little debt . |||O O O O O O O 
starbucks is not currently financing its growth with debt . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
considering its growth , this is amazing . |||O O O O O O O O 
it also means that starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting it s risk profile because ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
this allows the company to grow without debt . |||O O O O O O O O O 
you could argue that starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this option is another way that starbucks has retained its flexibility for the future . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
3 . starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits franchising . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
while starbucks does partner ( airlines , airports , barnes & noble ) , most of its stores are company owned . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
from a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures , product changes , and quality control . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i can not say if these factors justify the current share price but i would say that they justify a higher p/e ratio than the industry norm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
interesting aside : starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by krispy kreme . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the time of this writing i do not own starbucks stock ... but i am tempted and might consider a buy next week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i am also tempted to go buy a latte after writing this post . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

begala welcome back to crossfire . |||O O O O O O 
president bush today renewed his call for a $ 250,000 cap on pain and suffering damages from the victims of medical malpractice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
ironically down in north carolina today was also the day funeral services were held for 17 - year - old jesica santillan , the brave young woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplant operation last month . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is her family 's pain and suffering only worth $ 250,000 ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
here to debate medical malpractice reform are consumer advocate ralph nader and dr. donald palmisano , the president - elect of the american medical association . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
novak ralph nader , there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by the ama where doctors are going out of business because they ca n't afford the medical malpractice rates . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 'll just run a scroll of some of the states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
florida , new jersey , new york , ohio , pennsylvania , illinois , texas . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is a real crisis that lawyers have perpetrated on america , is n't it ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
another one of your leading questions . |||O O O O O O O 
this is a medical malpractice crisis . |||O O O O O O O 
over 80,000 americans , 220 every day die from medical negligence , hundred of thousands are injured . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
and the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income , its interest income , the stock market collapse down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and so they 're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but if you take the entire amount of premiums , bob , that 's paid by doctors in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly , they 'd be paying less than $ 9,000 each . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's one - third of what they pay a receptionist . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they ca n't afford it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
you know , ralph , you and i often agree on some things and one thing i think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
can you say that the lawyers , the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into democratic coffers in order to keep this , do you believe that this is healthy ... |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
nader well , as much as they 've poured into those coffers , it 's much less than what the doctors , the malpractice insurers , the hospital chains and the hmos and the nursing home chains have poured into members of congress ' coffers . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
this is first and foremost , bob , a question of equity . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that 's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that was n't indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the midwest , or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17 - year - old teenager in north carolina . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
are we going to say to these and so many others , you ca n't have your full day in court ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the united states at the state court level ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i have n't yet met one senator or representative who 's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent , unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice cases . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and i 've never heard one person say that the insurance executives who make $ 250,000 a week , every week without any pain and suffering , no one is saying cap those . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
begala dr. palmisano , first thank you for being here . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
dr. donald palmisano , president - elect , ama |||O O O O O O O O O 
there was a hear on capitol hill today . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
and , i want to ask you to respond to one of the witnesses , john mccormick testified today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he 's the father of a little girl , 13 - month - old girl , who he said today died because of medical malpractice . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
he said that the hospital ignored abnormal co2 levels in her blood . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
said that the attending physician had slept through several pages . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
listen to what mr. mccormick said and i 'll ask you to respond . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
john mccormick , father of malpractice victim mr. president , from father to father , my family 's pain and suffering are not frivolous . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is n't our president wrong to be -- did he win the lottery ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
you know , mr. bush -- president bush says these guys have won the litigation lottery . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
does that look like a lottery winner to you , holding a picture of his dead baby ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
well , the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they ca n't get access to care . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the american medical association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's why we founded the national patient safety foundation . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the current system does n't measure negligence . |||O O O O O O O O 
and what we 're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing , trauma centers are closing , pregnant women ca n't find a doctor to deliver the baby , a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer neurosurgeons available in the community . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the patient had to be airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
those are important points , i do n't doubt . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
but i wonder if you can respond to mr. mccormick 's point . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
who are you , who 's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $ 250,000 for the loss of a child ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
well , what has to be done here is balance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
what we need is a system that 's fair to everyone , a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and the system in california that 's in the bill , in congress now , hr - 5 , that 's a system that has worked . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it brought stability to california and obstetricians in california will pay 55 , 57 , $ 60,000 in los angeles and in south florida in miami , they 'll pay $ 210,000 ... ( crosstalk ) |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
because in california they have regulated the insurance company premium levels . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and in florida , they 've been very weak on it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and in some states , for example , there are doctors that are -- you know , there are 45 payouts in ten years and they 're not disciplined by the state medical board . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i mean , you 've got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percent of the payoffs , paul . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O 
in other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad , incompetent , indifferent , whatever . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they 're not performing properly and the ama is not cracking down , is not supporting expansion to state licensing ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i want to respond to that . |||O O O O O O O 
the national practitioner data bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
first of all , the government accounting office criticized the methodology used . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it lists multiple claims against one physician when actually it 's really one claim , different insurers pay on the same physician and it 's counted as one claim . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
it does n't mention whether they are obstetricians , neurosurgeons or emergency medicine . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
right now in south florida , in south florida , the latest poll shows that every neurosurgeon has been sued . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI 
the average number of suits against a neurosurgeon is five in south florida . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
now are these bad doctors ? |||O O O O O O 
we 'll have no doctors , we 'll have no neurosurgeons , no obstetricians ... |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've got to take a break . |||O O O O O O O O 
maybe they are bad doctors . |||O O O O O O

will vehrs 2005-02-22t08:17:00 del . adam ebbin ( d , alexandria ) is the first openly gay member to serve in the house of delegates . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's a brief profile of ebbin by kristen gelineau in today 's daily press . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what i found interesting was the contrast in reactions to ebbin from two colleagues : " i suppose that one of the concerns was that since he is the only openly gay member of the legislature , is whether or not that would be the only issue that he would ... talk about , " said del . ward armstrong , d - henry county . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" that clearly has not been the case . |||O O O O O O O O O 
he is a very versatile delegate . " |||O O O O O O O O 
richard black , r- loudoun , who has compiled a track record as one of the most socially conservative members of the state legislature and was the sponsor of the gay adoption bill , said he 's not trying to stamp out gay rights but is simply trying to preserve tradition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as for his personal feelings on ebbin , after a lengthy pause , the loudoun republican offered : " he 's always prompt and , you know , on time to meetings . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a moment later , he added , " i think he works hard . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think it 's possible to support some of black 's positions but still be very disappointed by his cold assessment of a colleague . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
paul ????-??-??t11:16:00 dick black is a statesman . |||O O O O O O O O 
odd how different our perceptions are . |||O O O O O O O 
i read black 's comment as more genuine and straightforward than armstrong 's . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i 'd much rather someone call me " prompt " and " hard - working " than " very versatile . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the latter sounds like weasel words -- " well , " johnnie 's teacher said , " he 's not too bright , and his table manners are atroctious , but he 's very versatile . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
maybe it was the pointed reference of the reporter to the pauses black made that troubled me . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i appreciate your take on it ; that 's why i love this comment section . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i may be way off - base . |||O O O O O O O O 
the ward armstrong comment is incredibly idiotic as well ... |||O O O O O O O O O O 
an old friend , joseph britt of kennesaw , ga , recently emailed to ask about anti-immigration as an issue for virginia democrats . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
joe had just read a george w. grayson article in the william & mary alumni magazine , " myths about illegal immigration . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
grayson does not cite any virginia examples , but among the " myths " he attempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs americans do n't want and that they contribute more in taxes and social security than they take from government programs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i personally know a good number of immigrants , both legal and illegal . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one fellow , a brazilian , has done everything by the book . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the immigration service ... not to mention , he 's paying the government thousands in taxes . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
he get s very frustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under the table . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they are n't paying lawyers , and they pay nothing into the system . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
of course , the americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay in cash because it means cheaper labor for them . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
the illegal immigrants themselves , of course . |||O O O O O O O O 
the employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native - born americans and legal immigrants . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and families who hire cheap domestic labor , whether to clean the house , wash the laundry or maintain the lawn . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
poor , native - born americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
legal immigrants like my brazilian friend , who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and the rest of us who wo n't hire anyone to work for us unless they 're paying their taxes , even if it means we pay more . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
yeah , i 've got a problem with turning around and giving illegal immigrants all the rights and privileges of the native born and the legal immigrants who 've played by the rules . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

now that saddam hussein 's regime has fallen is democracy the answer to iraq and its people . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in his book , fareed zakar ericks a joins us now to talk about democracy and iraq 's future . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
good to see you on a different network for a change . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
that 's what happens when you sell books . |||O O O O O O O O O 
let 's talk about what barbara starr was reporting from the pentagon . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
she says there is an acknowledgment from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in baghdad to control what our nic robertson is saying is a stage of anarchy in some parts of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
do you think the administration underestimated the day after ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
i think that there 's been a pattern here not just with this administration , but over the last ten years , bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , where we do n't quite recognize when the old order collapses , you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the short - term , that 's going to have to mean the american military . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the key question , which i try to address in the book , is what do you do after that ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or , in fact , interested in democracy ? |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there 's no proof of that . |||O O O O O O O 
well , the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good is to hold elections . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but if you hold elections , you stop the whole process of building a rule of law , creating courts , creating administration . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
we 've seen in the past in bosnia for example , you held elections and all of the old ethnic thugs get into power because they have organization and they have money and they stop the process of genuine building of democracy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
there is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get legitimate iraqi authority , but the faster you get that , the more likely you stop this process . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
so what do you think of this interim government ? |||O O O O O O O O O O 
you got deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz saying that american and british military forces would play a leading role in setting up an iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
is that going to work ? |||O O O O O O 
i think it will work if it 's truly broad - based and truly consensual , try and include all different people and including them in creating a constitution which would take a few years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
what i point out is the plays where you 've had quick transitions |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
