former senior banker callum mccarthy begins what is one of the most important jobs in london 's financial world in september , when incumbent howard davies steps down . |||B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O 
davies is leaving to become chairman of the london school of economics , one of the best - known parts of the university of london . |||O O B-TRI O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
brown said mccarthy would bring to the fsa " an unrivalled combination of experience of the public sector , experience as a senior practitioner in the financial services industry , and chairman of a highly successful regulator . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mccarthy currently heads the office of gas and electricity markets , or ofgem , which regulates britain 's privatised energy industry . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as well as previously holding senior positions at barclays bank , bzw and kleinwort benson , mccarthy was formerly a top civil servant at the department of trade and industry . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O

russia hints " peace camp " alliance with germany and france is dying by dmitry zaks |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
russian president vladimir putin 's summit with the leaders of germany and france may have been a failure that proves there can be no long - term " peace camp " alliance following the end of war in iraq , government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" senior government officials , speaking in the corridors of power in moscow , have no illusions about any long - term perspectives for the ( russian - german - french ) axis , " the respected izvestia daily reported . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" sooner or later iraq will fall and russia and the united sates will resume normal relations , " the senior moscow official , who was reported to be close to putin , told the paper . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" the situation in iraq does not mean that we intend to get into an argument with the united states . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the comments indicate that russia 's nuanced position over the war in iraq was becoming ever more scrambled , with putin pushing to protect his budding friendship with us president george w. bush in the face of strident opposition from the russian media and other top kremlin officials . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
analysts have long argued that putin is far keener to preserve friendly relations with the united states than the pro-european , anti-war camps embedded in much of the russian media and the foreign and defense ministries . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
russia 's foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a top washington official last week that moscow should forgive the eight billion dollars in soviet - era debt that baghdad owes it , as a gesture of good will . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
kommersant business daily joined in , declaring in a furious front - page headline : " the united states is demanding that russia , france and germany pay for the iraqi war . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O 
and the popular gazeta.ru news website stormed : " we should have expected this !.. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
this is only the start of a massive us campaign ( to decide iraq 's future finances ) . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
yet putin has been far more reserved . |||O O O O O O O O 
he and his loyal finance minister suggested friday that moscow might be prepared to waiver some of the iraqi debts in return for better russia - us relations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" on the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate , " putin said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" russia has no objections to such a proposal . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
putin concluded his two days of talks in saint petersburg with jacques chirac of france and german chancellor gerhard schroeder on saturday still urging for a central role for the united nations in a post-war revival of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leaders before the us - british invasion of iraq that un approval was essential for any mission to topple iraqi president saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but the saint petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration on iraq . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
and diplomats noted that putin appeared uncomfortable at being so closely associated with the anti-washington stance of schroeder and chirac amid his developing friendship with bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
putin had even secretly invited british prime minister tony blair , bush 's staunchest backer in the war on iraq , to attend the pow - wow in saint petersburg 's grand hotel europe , although diplomats said blair turned the offer down . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it remains to be seen how successful putin 's overtures to washington will be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the us war stance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O

some suggested that russian president vladimir putin will now be scrambling to contain the damage to his once - budding friendship with us president george w. bush because he was poorly advised by his intelligence and defense aides . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
one analyst said china -- which like russia and france wields a un security council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent the war -- recently won it s role as chief mediator between the united states and north korea because other regional powers ' confidence in russia fell as a result of its iraqi diplomacy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

negotiations between washington and pyongyang on their nuclear dispute have been set for april 23 in bejing and are widely seen here as a blow to moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region by organizing such a meeting . |||B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O

french president jacques chirac received only a reserved response when he tried to mend fences by placing a telephone call tuesday to bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
meanwhile german chancellor gerhard schroeder has not spoken to bush since several weeks before the start of the war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
but not everyone here agreed that moscow 's diplomatic relations with washington had suffered as badly . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most agreed that russian diplomacy miscalculated and urged putin to quickly reassess the quality of his advisers . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often reverts to cold war stereotypes , " said former deputy foreign minister anatoly adamishin . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we were so proud of forming an antiwar bloc with france and germany -- but nations have not been forming such blocs for at least 12 years and someone in moscow should have understood that it was impossible to avert this war .

we should continue sticking to our principles . " |||O O O O O O O O O 
khakamada argued that the united states would also need russia 's help " to make the new iraqi government seem legitimate . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
most analysts linked russia 's opposition to a war in iraq to fears that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now - toppled regime of saddam hussein . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the floodgates of iraqi oil are also now likely to open to world markets and hurt russia 's budget revenues -- which are heavily reliant on revenues from its own energy exports . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but few at the kremlin forum suggested that putin 's own standing among voters will be hurt by russia 's apparent diplomacy failures . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
putin will face re-election in march 2004 and analysts noted that the war -- while opposed by most russians -- was never turned by the kremlin into a matter of national security . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

judge shahid rafiq , of the district court in the industrial city of faisalabad , found ranjha masih guilty of defiling koranic verses during a protest rally by the minority christian community in 1998 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O

ranjha was accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from the koran in faisalabad during a christian demonstration after the city 's bishop committed suicide over the 1985 blasphemy law . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O

ayub masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending british author salman rushdie , whose novel " the satanic verses " infuriated radical mulsim clerics who accused the author of defaming islam . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

nkorea offers to scrap nuke , missile programs but wants big concessions : us |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
washington , april 28 ( afp ) - north korea has offered to scrap its nuclear weapons and missile programs , but only in return for " considerable " diplomatic , political and economic concessions , the united states said monday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
powell said the offer was made during three - way talks between us , north korean and chinese diplomats last week in beijing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the same meeting pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons , and threatened to prove it with a " display . " |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" the north koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and , in effect , said that these are now up for further discussion , " he told reporters at the state department . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" they did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities , but they , of course , expect something considerable in return , " powell said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we are studying that plan , we are examining it with our friends and allies , " powell said , adding that talks were now underway with the south korean , japanese , russian and australian as well as other governments . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" it was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here , " he said , referring to the april 23 to 25 discussions in beijing . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
powell gave no indication as to whether washington would accept the offer , and did not address what pyongyang was demanding in terms of concesssions . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however other us officials said the north koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the demands include full normalization of ties with the united states , security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" they had quite a list of things , " state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic assistance , boucher replied : " i do n't really quibble with that characterization of the list . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a senior state department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it defied a " concise description . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" it basically listed everything they have ever asked for , " the official told reporters on condition of anonymity , identifying oil and energy supplies as demands . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although the north korean demands are being looked at , boucher repeated long - standing us policy that washington would not be blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying pyongyang off . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we 've made clear we 're not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
powell acknowledged that north korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the beijing talks , but maintained that the north koreans had not used the words " test " or " testing . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" they said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the concessions demanded by pyongyang were part of a " bold " proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the korean peninsula that north korea presented in beijing , officials said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
south korean newspapers reported earlier monday that the north suggested that pyongyang and washington act simultaneously and equally to resolve the six - month - old nuclear crisis . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides , stressing that washington would not consider such moves until the " verifiable and irreversible termination " of the north 's nuclear programs . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we ( have ) made clear that once north korea did that , we could move on or move back to the comprehensive approach to us - north korea relations that we had talked about before , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ilbo newspapers and others quoted unnamed south korean government sources as saying pyongyang also urged washington not to hinder its efforts to establish and improve ties with seoul and tokyo . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the north 's ruling workers party newspaper , rodong sinmun , indicated sunday that north korea wanted economic and political " rewards " from the united states in return for the elimination of its nuclear program . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
rodong called for a " fair and equal " footing in talks with the united states , blasting washington for insisting that there would be " no security of the system nor provision of rewards " even if pyongyang gave up its nuclear program . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the ruling millennium democratic party ( mdp ) , founded by former president kim dae - jung , has suffered declining popularity since president roh moo - hyun took office in february . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O 
a group of 18 reformist mdp lawmakers , mostly roh 's confidants , demanded late wednesday that the party be " constructively dissolved " to create a new grouping , mdp officials said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O

reformist mdp members , however , vowed to launch a preparatory committee next month and to make " tangible progress " in the process of forging a new party . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
the internal dispute erupted after the mdp lost three parliamentary seats in thursday 's by - elections . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI I-TRI O

the daily planet raised 3.5 million dollars ( 2.2 million us ) in its initial public offering with one of the new 600 shareholders acquiring 1.0 million dollars worth of shares . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O

" heidi 's ideas , her background , her knowledge have helped us a great deal , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" the international novelty value with heidi promoting it has been massive -- these shares can go anywhere . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but it has n't been an easy road to the australian stock exchange since the idea was first mooted in 1994 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" the establishment did not want a brothel on the stock exchange , " harris said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" it 's only because we were the biggest and the best that we could afford to do it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we have fought every institution , every law firm ... it 's cost us a fortune but now we 're going on a massive expansion . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
harris said sydney was a more attractive option for the sex disneyland because its prostitution laws are less restrictive than melbourne 's . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" prostitution is completely decriminalised in sydney and we are going to build a monster , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O

the report came as the indebted group said it was planning to sell off its us unit vivendi universal entertainment and other assets , to focus on its telecoms activities and its french cable television business . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the times said vivendi universal was negotiating to sell its flagship theme parks to new york investment firm blackstone group as a the first step toward dismantling its entertainment empire . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
vivendi universal officials in the united states were not immediately available for comment on friday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
under the reported plans , blackstone group would buy vivendi 's theme park division , including universal studios hollywood , universal orlando in florida and universal 's ownership interests in parks in spain and japan , a source close to the negotiations told the paper . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that make up universal orlando . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
vivendi earlier this week confirmed months of press speculation that it planned to shed its entertainment assets by the end of the year , including its famed universal movie studio and television assets . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

tehran had been governed by reformists since 1989 , but a conservative city council was elected in the february 28 municipal polls in a result attributed to a meager turnout amid growing public disillusionment with electoral politics . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

mci to pay huge fine to sec for accounting fraud : report |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
mci , formerly world com , and the securities and exchange commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant 's 11 - billion - dollar ( 9.4 - billion - euro ) fraud case , the wall street journal reported monday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
under terms of the agreement , to be submitted as early as monday to a judge presiding over the case , mci would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the sec on a company that is not a broker - dealer , the journal said , citing sources close to the matter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the report did not give the amount of the fine , but said it would be " exponentially larger " than the historic 10 million dollars xerox paid the sec last year . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
last month , the sec slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10 wall street brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interest between analysts and investors . |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
mci and the sec negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in november under which mci , formerly known as world com , agreed not to mislead investors about its finances , and to improve internal controls , the journal said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions , swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on , the report said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
separately , former world com ceo bernard ebbers failed on april 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars , plus interest , on a 400 - million - dollar loan from mci , the journal said , citing sec documents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O

meanwhile coalition officials in iraq insisted plans for an iraqi government were still on track and russia hinted that a compromise could be imminent on a un draft resolution to lift economic sanctions on iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
thousands of iraq 's majority shiite muslims marched to their main mosque in baghdad to mark the birthday of islam 's founder prophet mohammed . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
shiites , who celebrate the birthday a week later than sunni muslims , were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of saddam hussein 's sunni-dominated regime . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the crowd filled the street leading to the kazimiya mosque in the northeast of baghdad and carried banners in the green color of islam , calling for good government . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" no to injustice , " " no to occupation , " " no to israel , " " yes to islam , " chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
imam mohammad al - fartussi , who last week threatened violence against " sinful " women , alcohol vendors and cinemas showing " indecent " films , offered praise for the fall of saddam and called iraq " the land of imams ... land of islam . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the demonstration came as iraq 's top us overseer paul bremer began his second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in the country . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in his frenzied first seven days , the telegenic bremer repeatedly promised to restore the law and order that crumbled along with saddam hussein 's regime nearly six weeks ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
but despite issuing a host of tough decrees , bremer has failed to stem the rampant crime and street violence plaguing the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O 
despite a security crackdown over the weekend in baghdad and an announcement that some 7,000 policemen had returned to their jobs since the end of the war , ordinary iraqis still felt unsafe on the street with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in baghdad , almost all the police stations have been destroyed or looted since us troops took control of the capital on april 9 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

baghdad 's top police job remains vacant . |||O O O O O O O O

packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy of theft that followed the collapse of saddam 's regime , the traders deal in everything from computers and stereos to furniture and weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
jalal jamil , a 45 - year - old jewellery store owner , said the situation just keeps getting worse . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" the americans encourage people to steal because when looting happens right under their noses they do nothing , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bremer has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier us timeline on forming a government in iraq , but us - led coalition officials monday insisted government plans were still on track . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we want to have an iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would be wrong to do that precipitously , " said a source at the organisation of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance ( orha ) , which is administering post-war iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O

a referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new government , the 80 - year - old pachachi told the daily . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
on the diplomatic front , a top russian official said monday that the un security council would likely vote this week on a us - british draft resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on iraq in 1990 after its invasion of kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalition control for at least a year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

yet fedotov did not say whether russia would back the resolution , which diplomats have been revising since the united states , britain and spain first submitted it more than a week ago . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
russia " will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out to be , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i plan a thorough exchange of views with president vladimir putin on bilateral and important regional and international issues , " hu said in an interview with russia 's interfax news agency . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" our discussions should strengthen political trust between the two sides and mutually beneficial cooperation to raise russian - chinese relations to a new level , " he added . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
putin , who enjoyed a warm relationship with former chinese president jiang zeming , has made efforts to nurture ties with hu and was the first world leader to go to beijing to meet him in december when he was president - in - waiting . |||O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

russia has given a high priority to its relations with the united states despite a bitter disagreement over the us - led campaign to topple saddam hussein in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
but china remains a key russian ally , demonstrated by the fact that hu will be the only foreign leader apart from us president george w. bush to hold a summit with putin in the days surrounding the saint petersburg festivities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
leaders of the two asian giants , according to ufg financial brokerage , may ink a deal for the construction of a 2,400 kilometre ( 1,500 - mile ) oil pipeline from eastern siberia to the chinese city of daqing , bringing russian crude to energy - hungry china . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although the russian government is formally committed to building an extension of the pipeline that would supply japan through the russian port of nakhodka , experts believe that project is unlikely to see the light of day . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
russian oil giant yukos , whose output will be shipped through the pipeline , had lobbied furiously for the chinese route although the state pipeline monopoly transneft argued that it was wrong to tie strategic russian energy resources to the whims of a single buyer . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" single customers are always a danger . |||O O O O O O O O 
however , the project makes economic sense , " commented asia expert dmitry trenin , deputy director in moscow of the carnegie center , a washington - based think tank . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the shorter chinese route , a 2,400 - kilometre project , would cost around half the japanese pipeline , at 2.5 billion dollars ( 2.15 billion euros ) , and would need to transport just 20 million tonnes a year to be economic . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
china , whose booming economy has turned the country into an increasingly valuable economic partner for russia , especially in its backward far eastern regions , is also a major purchaser of russian weapons . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" it 's a very important relationship . |||O O O O O O O O 
china is a very dynamic neighbour and a rising world power . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in many ways it is far ahead of russia , " trenin said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the chinese president expressed the hope that bilateral trade could be raised from its current level of 12 billion dollars a year to 20 billion dollars . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
analysts however cautioned against any attempt to turn the focus from economic cooperation to a broader strategic alliance , given that both sides opposed the war in iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
" the chinese are trying to establish a rapport ( between hu and putin ) and this is in russia 's interests . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
however , this rapport should not serve the role of forming an alliance to counter american dominance in the world , " said trenin . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" a lot can be said for an amicable , neighbourly relationship between moscow and beijing and this is what the rapport should serve , " he added . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the twins , both qualified lawyers aged in their late 20s , are joined at the head and the operation involves separating two individually functioning brains encased within a single bony structure , neurosurgeon keith goh said in december . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

" our belief is that any proliferation , coming from any source , should be stopped . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the united states believes that what iran says is a peaceful civilian nuclear program is a pretext for weapons manufacture . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
washington has been pressuring russia to stop building a nuclear power plant in bushehr , southern iran , which it has so far declined to do . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" i appreciate vladimir putin 's understanding of the issue and his willingness to work with me and others to solve this potential problem , " said bush . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
putin insisted that the two sides were " closer than they seem " on the issue . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we do not need to be convinced of the fact that there should no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but in a sharp remark that jolted the bonhomie , putin warned russia was not yet ready to sever nuclear ties with iran . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" we are against the pretext of using the nuclear weapons program in iran as a lever in unfair business competition against us , " he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush signalled that russia would not pay a similar price as france and germany for opposing the us - led war in iraq , inviting his " good friend " putin to his weekend retreat outside camp david in washington in september . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
putin last visited bush at his texas ranch in november 2001 . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
there was no word on the fate of billions of dollars of russian oil contracts in iraq , whose oil industry is now under the administration of the united states and britain in line with latest un resolutions , which russia was persuaded to back . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but putin noted that " russian companies have a wealth of experience operating in iraq and we intend to continue our cooperation in this area , with iraq and in iraq . " |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" what the president ( putin ) meant was that at times , and we have come across this , there were unreasonable complaints about russian companies ' cooperation with iran , " said foreign minister igor ivanov , pointing the finger clearly at the united states after the summit . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
bush and putin also signed formal documents putting into effect a strategic arms reduction treaty that slashes the two sides ' nuclear weapons to a range of 1,700 to 2,200 nuclear warheads by the year 2012 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush arrived in saint petersburg on saturday , when he also briefly met german chancellor gerhard schroeder , whose opposition to the iraq war had soured his relationship with washington , at a dinner hosted by putin . |||O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

israel hands over rafah border crossing to palestinians attention - recasts with return to pre-intifada positions , adds details /// |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gaza city , june 30 ( afp ) |||O O O O O O O O 
palestinian security forces returned monday to the positions they held in the gaza strip before the outbreak of the 33 - month palestinian uprising as israel removed all major checkpoints in the coastal territory , a palestinian security source said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
police officers took up their positions across the gaza strip , enjoying a freedom of movement they have not known since the intifada exploded in september 2000 , the source said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
" palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions they held before september 28 , 2000 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is the first time they have had freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the intifada , " the source said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the us - backed middle east " roadmap " , which aims to end the months of bloodshed and create a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
following the withdrawal of israeli troops from the northern town of beit hanoun late sunday , police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of beit lahiya , he said . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
they also deployed along the border with israel . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the handover is a credibility test for the palestinian authority , which must show it means business when it comes to reining in hardline groups plotting attacks on the jewish state . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
in another first in the almost three - year intifada , the israeli army allowed palestinians free circulation on the trans - gaza highway as troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O 
traffic was flowing freely through the netzarim junction , just south of gaza city , the kissufi m junction by deir al - balah in the central gaza strip , and the guest house junction just south of deir al - balah after the army withdrew . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the three military checkpoints on the highway , which runs the entire length of the gaza strip , had transformed the trip from north to south , ordinarily a 30 - minute ride , into a grinding two or three - hour ordeal and came to symbolise the horrors of occupation . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
" israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few issues , " the source said , pointing out that israel had still not removed two military observation posts at the kissufi m junction and the guest house junction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although there was free movement along the trans - gaza highway , several other roads remained temporarily closed , he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the karni - netzarim road , which runs east - to - west across the route , was still closed as was the section of the highway passing close by kfar darom settlement , just south of the guest house junction , he said , adding both were likely to be opened in the coming weeks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
another road , leading from the southern border town of rafah to khan yunis , would be opened within 10 days , he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
adressing palestinian complaints , an israeli military source confirmed troops had installed a gate at the netzarim crossing and at the southern guest house junction but said that they were only there for when jewish settlers needed to use the road . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a ban on palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to move freely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later on monday or early tuesday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the army also handed over control of rafah border crossing between the gaza strip and egypt to the palestinians , security sources said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
six palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the palestinian section of the border crossing , which had been taken over by israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
oslo accords , which granted a measure of autonomy to the palestinians , the rafah border crossing with egypt was to be jointly managed by both israel and the palestinians , although israel had final control over the zone . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
although the crossing has , in principle , been open for movement between the two territories -- while being frequently closed by israeli for reasons rarely explained -- the palestinian section has been manned by israel for more than two years . |||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
white house raises possibility it might not seek u.n. vote with eu-gen -- turkey - us - iraq ; un-gen -- n -iraq |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
with opposition hardening , the white house left open the possibility tuesday that it would not seek a united nations vote on its war - making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
it is not necessary , '' presidential spokesman ari fleischer said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the comments came as president george w. bush and his advisers looked beyond the diplomatic showdown and made plans for a public relations buildup to potential war . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
one option under serious consideration was bush giving iraqi leader saddam hussein a final ultimatum , perhaps with a short - term deadline , in a major address next week , two senior white house officials said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , stressed that a variety of options are on the table and they all depend on the outcome of a u.n. security council debate on the u.s. - backed war resolution . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
the united states still does n't have the nine votes needed to win approval of the resolution , according to supporters and opponents , and many undecided council members are looking for a compromise . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even if he gets the required votes , bush needs to avoid a veto by russia , france or china who all favor continuing inspections at least into july . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
once the vote is resolved one way or another , bush will intensify his case for war , officials said , barring unforeseen events such as saddam suddenly disarming or going into exile . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in addition to a possible address , they have discussed a presidential news conference and a cabinet meeting as ways for bush to communicate his plans to the nation next week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
as those discussions were taking place behind the scenes , fleischer told reporters that turkey would lose a proposed $ 15 billion aid package unless it admits troops into the country for the iraq conflict . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
`` the particular package that we 've been talking to them about was predicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use of force against iraq , '' fleischer said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
until tuesday , the spokesman had suggested part of the package would be available to turkey regardless of whether 62,000 american troops are allowed in the country . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
white house officials said they were turning up pressure on turkey in hopes that the parliament would grant the u.s. request on a second vote . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
even so , officials said future aid for turkey would not be ruled out , just the massive package under consideration now . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
at the united nations , secretary - general kofi annan called baghdad 's missile destruction `` a positive development , '' putting him at odds with bush 's assessment . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
russia 's foreign minister igor ivanov , hardening moscow 's opposition to quick military action , indicated russia may use its veto against the u.s. - backed resolution . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
both developments further complicated bush 's efforts to win passage of the resolution , adding significance to talk of what the administration would do if u.n. opposition cements against the u.s. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` the president has made clear , that ... whether the united nations votes or does not vote , that we will disarm saddam hussein with a coalition of the willing , '' fleischer said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` we are proceeding with all the plans for the vote . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` now , if you are asking me if all of a sudden support around the world crumbles and there is absolutely no one for it , i ca n't predict with metaphysical certitude every eventuality , '' fleischer said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
u.s. ambassador john negroponte was asked whether the united states would withdraw the resolution if it did n't have the votes to pass it . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` we have n't crossed that bridge , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` we believe that support should be there . |||O O O O O O O O O 
we are not facing that kind of situation but we will cross the bridge when we come to it . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
afterward , he and other white house officials said the remarks did not signal a lack of confidence in the resolution 's prospects . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the belgrade district court said that markovic will be tried along with 10 other milosevic - era officials who face similar charges of `` inappropriate use of state property '' that carry a sentence of up to five years in jail . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O

iraq resumed destroying banned al samoud 2 missiles under u.n. supervision saturday after taking a day off , crushing six more in a process that chief inspector hans blix called a `` substantial measure of disarmament . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in the past week , iraq has destroyed 40 of its 100 al samoud 2 missiles , prohibited by the united nations because some tests indicated they could fly farther than 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
it also has been destroying equipment used to make them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O 
reports to the security council on friday by blix and chief nuclear inspector mohammed elbaradei praised iraq 's recent compliance . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
but inspectors also questioned iraq 's motivation , as it began to give the inspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
u.s. president george w. bush said the reports indicated that only a war will make iraq disarm . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
`` unfortunately , it is clear that saddam hussein is still violating the demands of the united nations by refusing to disarm , '' he told americans in a radio address saturday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iraq , however , took the report as an endorsement of its work and argued not only that war plans should be canceled , but that sanctions imposed on it by the security council for its 1990 invasion of kuwait should be removed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
`` we demand that the security council and the world decide on ... the lifting of sanctions on iraq in a comprehensive and complete way , '' said a spokesman for a meeting saturday of saddam and top - level officials , quoted by official iraqi news media . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the unidentified spokesman claimed the weapons inspectors had verified iraq has rid itself of weapons of mass destruction _ something the inspectors said would take months to do _ and appealed for a ban on such weapons to be extended beyond iraq : to israel , and eventually to the united states . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the spokesman , reporting on the meeting , said iraq called on the security council ``to rid the middle east of weapons of mass destruction since iraq has become free of them . '' |||O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` at the front of those that must be rid of these weapons is the zionist entity , '' he said in a reference to israel , adding that the order should `` move on after this region to america . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the newspaper babil , a popular daily owned by saddam 's son odai , also said saturday that the reports of blix and elbaradei were enough to suspend the sanctions , which are to be removed when the united nations verifies that iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or the means to make them . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in a front - page editorial , babil said the reports should push security council members ``to think seriously about issuing a resolution lifting the sanctions imposed on iraq , since it was proven that we do n't possess weapons of mass destruction . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
saddam has long claimed iraq destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the united states and britain claim he 's lying , and have assembled a quarter -million troops around iraq for a possible invasion . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
despite iraq 's demands of the security council , diplomats were working hard on very different proposals : a u.s. - led plan for disarmament or war by march 17 , and a rival french plan for an emergency summit of security council members to come up with a compromise . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
bush and top advisers planned to lobby allies by telephone through the weekend and up until next week 's planned vote on the ultimatum . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
french president jacques chirac talked to heads of state in an effort to drum up support for his plan , his office said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
inspectors ' spokesman hiro ueki said iraqi workers crushed six al samoud 2 missiles saturday at the al - taji military complex north of baghdad , under the supervision of weapons inspectors . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
three of the missiles had warheads and three did n't , apparently because they had n't been deployed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
inspectors also supervised the destruction of tools and `` special equipment used to produce the al samoud 2 engine '' at the al samoud factory , he said , and another group of inspectors verified the emptying of al samoud 2 warheads at the qa qa complex just south of baghdad . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
odai al - taie , a senior information ministry official , said the workers crushing the missiles took friday off because they had worked on tuesday , the muslim new year . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ueki described friday as a `` planning day '' for teams working on missile destruction . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ueki said an iraqi chemical scientist granted an interview to weapons inspectors , bringing to eight the number of scientists who have given interviews since feb. 28 , when iraq began urging them to talk . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
since the same date , four scientists have refused . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
interviews with nuclear scientists have been conducted more frequently because the nuclear inspectors do n't mind the scientists tape recording the interviews , a sticking point for the chemical and biological teams . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
inspectors also returned to a former helicopter airfield where iraq buried bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991 . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
ueki said inspectors there took samples from the remainders of stainless steel containers iraq says it used to transport biological agents . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
report : hong kong jockey club in talks to acquire its macau rival |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the hong kong jockey club is in talks about buying out the horse racing club in neighboring macau , a newspaper reported tuesday . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI I-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the south china morning post quoted hong kong jockey club chief executive lawrence |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
wong as saying the discussions were underway , but no price was reported . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the hong kong club is a charitable entity , while the macau jockey club is a for - profit concern controlled by gambling tycoon stanley ho . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hong kong angered macau 's gaming industry last year when it banned gamblers in hong kong from placing horse bets with anyone but the hong kong jockey club . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
macau had been taking off - track bets from people in hong kong , but the offices handling those wagers were closed . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the macau club later threatened to start taking wagers on hong kong races in macau , at a better price for gamblers because less tax would be levied , but the plan never materialized . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
neither club immediately returned phone calls from the associated press to inquire about the buyout talks . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O 
macau is a gambling enclave 60 kilometers ( 40 miles ) west of hong kong that was governed by the portuguese for more than four centuries before it returned to chinese sovereignty in 1999 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
hong kong , a former british colony , returned to chinese rule in 1997 . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
turkish party leader recep tayyip erdogan named prime minister , may push to allow in u.s. troops |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the charismatic leader of turkey 's governing party was named prime minister tuesday , a step that probably boosts chances that the united states will get permission to deploy troops in the country along iraq 's northern border . |||O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
recep tayyip erdogan , who favors the deployment , hinted that he will reshuffle the cabinet , but gave no indication if he would purge officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have suggested he might do . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
erdogan is extremely popular in turkey and is likely be one of the few leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain public support for allowing in the u.s. |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
turks overwhelmingly oppose a war _ by 94 percent , according to some polls . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O 
earlier this month , the turkish parliament shocked the united states by rejecting the deployment by just four votes . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
erdogan has hinted that he will resubmit the resolution for approval , which could take another week . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
the united states is pressing turkey to act quickly . |||O O O O O O O O O O 
ships carrying equipment for u.s. troops are already waiting off the turkish coast |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
in washington , joint chiefs of staff chairman gen. richard myers told a pentagon news conference tuesday that the united states would `` have a northern option whether or not turkey fully supports all our requests . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` i 'm not going to talk about the operational ways of doing it , but just be assured there will be a northern option , '' he said . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
also in washington , turkish ambassador farouk logoglu told the associated press that the u.s. and turkish militaries were holding informal discussions on the use of turkish airspace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O 
the troop - basing resolution would allow the united states to use turkish airspace . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
if the resolution is not passed , washington would likely want to use the airspace for strikes against iraq and for airlifting troops to northern iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O B-TRI O O O O O 
refusing access to the troop deployment would mean turkey would lose a us $ 15 billion u.s. aid package that washington has offered to help cushion the country 's economy if there is war . |||O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
it would also threaten turkey 's possible role in the future of iraq . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
turkey , which fears northern iraqi kurds may declare independence in the aftermath of a war , has been pressing for a say if saddam hussein is ousted . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
secession by iraqi kurds could inspire |||O O O O O O 
turkey 's rebel kurds , who for 15 years have been fighting for autonomy . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
after he was elected , erdogan said turkey wanted assurances from the united states on its role in iraq . |||O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld said tuesday there had been talks that turkish troops could be deployed `` a short distance from their border to try to avoid refugee infiltration . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
iraqi kurds fear that turkish troops could move deep into the autonomous enclave in northern iraq and have threatened clashes . |||O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O 
rumsfeld also said that like turkey , the united states does n't want to see a breakaway state : `` our interest , needless to say , is to see that iraq remains a single country , '' he said at the pentagon news conference . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
prime minister abdullah gul resigned earlier tuesday to make way for erdogan , who won a parliamentary seat in by - elections sunday . |||O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
gul will remain as a caretaker prime minister until president ahmet necdet sezer approves erdogan 's cabinet , a move that could happen as early as wednesday . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
erdogan said he would submit his cabinet list to the president `` as soon as possible , '' and leaders of erdogan 's justice and development party met tuesday evening . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O 
when asked about possible changes in the cabinet , erdogan said : `` perhaps there will be a small amount of change , a certain number of revisions . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
gul 's resignation had been long expected . |||O O B-TRI O O O O O 
erdogan heads the party but was constitutionally barred from running in november elections because he was jailed in 1999 for anti-secular activities . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O 
the justice party changed the constitution after taking power in the elections . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
erdogan , a leader of turkey 's pro-islamic movement when he was jailed , said he moderated his policies in prison . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O 
his party considers itself conservative and no longer uses the word ' islamic ' in its literature . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he now also advocates letting in u.s. troops for a war against iraq even though it is a fellow muslim state . |||O O O O O O O O O O B-TRI O O O O O O O O O O O 
unlike the soft - spoken gul , erdogan has a reputation as a fighter . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` erdogan will be willing to engage in a bruising confrontation in a way that gul was not willing to , '' said bulent aliriza , an analyst at the washington - based center for strategic and international studies . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
`` if erdogan decides that for his own reasons , and not u.s. pressure , he wants this , he will push it through . '' |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
tensions over the basing agreement spilled over into parliament tuesday when opposition deputy ufuk ozkan shouted `` you are all american lackeys ! '' at members of erdogan 's party , the anatolia news agency reported . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
a furious justice party member , fehmi husrev kutlu , rushed toward ozkan , bumping into him and sending his eyeglasses flying , anatolia reported . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

blair was confident of retaining the support of a majority of parliament as he can count on votes from opposition conservatives . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
he told the house of commons the iraq crisis was testing the fundamentals of international relations . |||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
