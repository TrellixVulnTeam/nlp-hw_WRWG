it	O

that	O

if	O

One	O
very	O
bad	O
argument	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
by	O
Kevin	O
Bachler	O
,	O
which	O
to	O
be	O
fair	O
was	O
surrounded	O
by	O
arguably	O
better	O
ones	O
,	O
was	O
that	O
since	O
this	O
board	B-Person
was	O
elected	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
let	O
them	O
do	O
as	O
they	O
please	O
.	O

Which	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
there	O
might	O

well	O
not	O
be	O
bylaws	O

ethics	O
standards	O

since	O
an	O

is	O
not	O
bound	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

Another	O
argument	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
better	O
but	O
still	O
disturbing	O
,	O
is	O
that	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
ethics	O
violation	O
,	O
and	O
maybe	O
worse	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
only	O
hurt	O
the	O
USCF	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O
,	O

that	O
only	O
troublemakers	O

,	O
I	O

me	O
,	O
would	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O
